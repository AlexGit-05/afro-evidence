Yongolo CMS Senior Lecturer, Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences. P.O. Box 7845 Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. E-mail: syongolo@muchs.ac.tz Objective: To determine the proportion of patients with Carcinoma of the Prostate in patients presenting with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms. Methods: This was a four years prospective case finding study of patients aged 50 years and above with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) in a private hospital in Dar-Es Salaam. Investigations included renal function tests, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and prostatic biopsy. Results: Of the 201 consecutive patients with LUTS, 86.1% had BPH while 13.9% had Prostate Carcinoma (CP) with an average PSA of 51.99 ng/ ml. Digital rectal examination (DRE) was abnormal in 23 cancer patients. In 2 patients diagnosis followed finding a raised PSA. In 3 patients carcinoma was an incidental finding following TURP. Treatment consisted of orchidectomy in 24 patients, Lutenizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) agonist (Zoladex) in two while one patient received radiotherapy. Two of the patients who had incidental CP finding with low Gleason score were on watchful waiting. Conclusion: Case finding rather than community screening for prostate cancer is preferred due to economic reasons. PSA when available is a useful additional investigation. Efforts should be made to detect the disease early as the urologists in the region arm themselves ready for the challenge of radical prostatectomy. Introduction Patients with prostate cancer may present with voiding symptoms suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction or those related to metastatic disease. The prevalence of prostate cancer continues to increase with age, and after age 50, both incidence and mortality rate from prostate cancer increase at a near exponential rate1. At present, prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the United States and the second most common cause of cancer death. Blacks living in the USA have a higher incidence rate of clinical prostate cancer than white men of similar education and socio-economic classes at all ages2. Furthermore, black men are routinely diagnosed with late stage disease, and survival rates, even when correlated for stage, are uniformly lower for black men. The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is made, in the majority of cases, by prostatic needle biopsy. Thus, suspicion of prostate cancer is most often raised by abnormalities found on digital rectal examination (DRE), or serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevations. Routine use of PSA increases the detection of prostate cancer over that of DRE, improves the predictive value of the DRE for cancer, and increases the detection of prostate cancers that are organ confined yet significant in terms of size and grade. PSA is the single test with the highest positive predictive value for cancer of the prostate 3. It has been reported in different studies in screened populations that the approximate chance of cancer on biopsy is 1 in 50 for men with PSA levels below 4.0 ng/ml3, 1 in 4 for PSA levels of 4.0 to 10 ng/ml, and 1 in 2 to 3 for PSA levels greater than 10 ng/ml4,5. PSA increases the predictive value of the DRE for cancer of the prostate6,7. A decrease in the mortality rate of prostate cancer following introduction of screening has been reported8,9. In developing countries however, health provision is sub-optimal due to poor economy, and screening procedures cannot be done due to cost constraints. It follows therefore that the use of PSA as a screening tool for CP in the community is not feasible10,11. Introduction of new diagnostic tests in developing countries are delayed and when available are expensive and inaccessible to the general public. When introduced few private laboratories own them. This prohibits the tests to be used for screening purposes. PSA was introduced in Tanzania five years ago. This paper presents the experience on case finding of prostate cancer in patients presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in a private clinic in Dar- Es Salaam. East and Central African Journal of Surgery Volume 9 Number 2 - December2004 18 Patients and Methods This was a prospective case finding study of four years in a private hospital in the centre of Dar-Es Salaam during the period of January 2000 to December 2003. Patients eligible for this study were all those who were 50 years or more who presented with lower urinary tract symptoms requiring investigations and treatment. The hospital had one working urologist who saw all patients presenting with urology problems. Those patients had a history and physical examination done except digital rectal examination (DRE), which was carried out after blood for PSA had been drawn. Other investigations done included serum creatinine, abdominal ultrasound of the kidney, ureter, bladder and prostate. The hospital has no rectal probe for Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS). The other investigations were tailored to the other presenting symptoms and signs of the patient. Those who had urethral stricture with a normal PSA and DRE were however excluded, as the tissue biopsy was not obtained. The age of the patient and the presenting symptoms were recorded. The urologist documented all the findings of the DRE. Those patients who had abnormal DRE findings in the prostate had a tru-cut biopsy taken from the prostate by finger guidance. Patients who had an elevated PSA without suspicious nodule had sextant core biopsies done. Cut off point for PSA in the lab was 4ng/ml. Patients who had significant urinary symptoms were treated by TURP or open prostatectomy. Tissues from prostatectomy were examined to determine whether prostate cancer was evident. The Gleason score was also done and recorded at histology. Patients with prostate cancer were treated by Orchidectomy, Lutenizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) agonist (Zoladex), Radiotherapy or watchful waiting according to the stage and grade of the disease. Results A total of 219 consecutive patients with lower urinary tract symptoms were seen at the hospital. However 201 are presented in this study. Eighteen patients who had LUTS secondary to urethral stricture were excluded as none of them had prostate biopsy done. The age range of the patients was from 50 to 98 with a mean of 68.4 years. The majority (72.1%) of the patients belonged to the age groups 60\u201369 and 70\u201379 (Table 1). Table 1. Age distribution of the studied patients Age Group Number Of Patients Percentage 50-59 35 17.4 60-69 69 34.3 70-79 76 37.8 80-89 17 8.5 >90 4 2 Total 201 100 Table 2.

Detection of Carcinoma of the prostate. Method Of Detection Number Of Patient Abnormal DRE 23 Raised PSA 2 Incidental Carcinoma 3 The reason for consultation was significant bothersome symptoms of lower urinary tract in 101 (50.2%) of the patients and retention of urine in 86 (42.8%). The other presenting features were stones, hernia and UTI. Two patients had paraplegia due to metastasis of CP to the spine (Table 2). Taking all patients together the average PSA measured by Min-Vadas France BioMurex Lab reagents was 13.12ng/ml. However the average PSA in the 173 patients with BPH was 6.71ng/ml. Patients with prostatic cancer had an average PSA of 51.99ng ml. The range of PSA was 0.68 to >100 ng/ml. The upper range in this laboratory was indicated as more than 100 a draw back to the average results of PSA to cancer group of patients. Twenty-eight (13.9%) of all patients had prostate cancer and had an average age of 68.7 years. Apart from lower urinary tract symptoms some patients presented with metastatic symptoms of paraplegia, low back pain, anaemia, oedema of the legs, weight loss and general weakness. The DRE was abnormal in 23 patients together with raised PSA. Two patients without abnormality of DRE were diagnosed CP on finding a raised PSA. The other three patients were diagnosed as incidental findings from TURP with a normal PSA (Table 3). Twenty-four patients had Orchidectomy as the treatment (one patient started with Zoladex and had to have Orchidectomy done due to cost constraint); one patient was treated with LHRH agonist Zoladex while one patient received radiotherapy outside the country. Two of the three patients who had incidental carcinoma with a favourable Gleason score were managed on watchful waiting with regular PSA checks. Discussion The advantage of early diagnosis of prostate cancer and its treatment by radical surgery and its influence to survival is well documented12. Being asymptomatic in the early stage, prostate cancer discovery is facilitated by the use of screening and PSA, which has increased the detection and lead to the recommendation of mass screening for it13,14. However the debate on the logic of treatment of localized disease, which is usually found during screening with the slow growth of the tumour has also been posed15. Moreover community screening of prostate cancer by use of PSA is expensive and though desirable is prohibitive in poor countries where case finding studies will remain the main source of data. The mean age in this series of patients was slightly higher than those reported in one publication in this continent10. All of the patients had significant lower urinary tract symptoms. The majority of the patients (86.1%) were found to have BPH while 13.9% had prostate cancer. This ratio is slightly higher than that reported in Egypt10 but is comparable with findings in another study which on top of DRE and PSA used Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) which could probably explain the higher pick up ratio16. The high ratio in our series of patients, may be an indication of a possibly high incidence of Carcinoma of the Prostate in our population in black Africa. Indeed prostate cancer rarely causes symptoms early in the course of disease because the majority (70- 85%) of adenocarcinoma arises in the periphery of the gland (peripheral zone), distant from the urethra. In the other group of patients (15-30%), the cancer develops from the other zones. The presence of symptoms as a result of prostate cancer suggests coexistence with BPH, a locally advanced or metastatic disease, as was the case in the majority of our patients who had advanced disease at diagnosis. Only five patients out of the twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with early malignancy and would qualify for Radical Prostatectomy. All suspicious lesions at DRE underwent a biopsy and confirmed the disease a high pick up rate. In one series it was reported that approximately 50% of suspicious lesions represented cancer on prostate biopsy 17. Because of the significant risk of prostate cancer, prostate biopsy is recommended for all men East and Central African Journal of Surgery Volume 9 Number 2 - December2004 20 who have DRE abnormalities, regardless of the PSA level, since there is still a chance, however small of CP even when PSA level is less than 4 ng/ml 3. It is of paramount important to note here that till now clinical presentation and abnormal DRE remains the main way of diagnosis of CP in most of the hospitals in this country. However, we also emphasize that DRE misses from 23% to 45% of the cancers that are subsequently found with prostatic biopsies done for serum PSA elevation or Trans-rectal ultrasound abnormalities18,19. In our series five patients would have been missed since their DRE was normal. The studied population here is not a representative sample as this was a selected group who can afford treatment in a private hospital. Secondly the number of patients is small to draw a conclusion but the proportion of CP is high. Also the stage at which the disease at diagnosis was advanced similar to What others report that prostate cancer detected by DRE in screened and unscreened populations of men are pathologically advanced in more than 50% of men15. Where possible in developing countries a combination of DRE and PSA in patients with LUTS should be used to pick up more cases with CP. There is however a need to establish the true prevalence of CP in a black African country by a well planned randomized study using PSA, DRE and TRUS. References 1.

Introduction Prostate cancer (PC) is curable with screening and early detection, yet it remains a major public health problem globally as it is among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among men worldwide. African men suffer disproportionately from PC with higher mortality reported among men in Sub-Saharan Africa (1, 2). In Kenya, PC is ranked as the most prevalent cancer in males with 2864 new cases (14.9%) in 2018 (3). Generally, low rates of PC screening have been reported among Black men (4, 5). Globally, prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening remains a much debated issue with varying recommendations across countries. Nevertheless, there is a general agreement on utilization of shared decision-making in-line with the US Preventive MBUGUA ET AL. July 2021 | Volume 18 | Issue 3 131 The ANNALS of AFRICAN SURGERY| www.annalsofafricansurgery.com Services Task Force recommendations (6). The screening guidelines in Kenya recommend individualized risk-based screening through shared decision-making between the client and clinician among men aged 40\u201369 years (3). The screening rates, however, remain abysmally low despite high intention to screen (7\u201310). Unfortunately, the number of men diagnosed with advanced aggressive PC is on the rise with an alarming increase in mortality attributed to low uptake of screening (3, 11). Despite equivocal evidence given on the effects of PC screening on mortality, risk-based screening aimed at early treatment initiation is vital (7). The low uptake of PC screening among Kenyan men despite a considerably high level of awareness remains a great puzzle in public health that requires further investigation. There is a paucity of studies on barriers to PC screening in developing countries. The few studies carried out in Kenya are quantitative, hence they lack a deeper exploration of the factors influencing screening. The success of PC prevention and control programs requires an in-depth understanding of contextual factors influencing uptake of screening. The study therefore applied a qualitative approach to explore context-specific barriers and facilitators to PC screening among Kenyan men in a rural community. Methods Design We used a descriptive exploratory qualitative study design. Study site The study was conducted in Gatundu-North and Kiambu Sub-counties in Kiambu County, which are located in the central region of Kenya. The sub- counties were selected as they have linked health facilities which offer PC screening services. The population in the study area is demarcated into Community Units (CUs) for the purpose of implementation of community health strategy. All the 17 CUs were included in the study. Study population The study participants included 59 men aged 40\u201369 years, the eligible age for screening in Kenya (3). The key informants (KIs) included members of the County and Sub-county Health Management Committee including public health nurses and officers and community health strategy coordinators. Sampling technique The focus group discussion (FGD) participants were purposively selected which aimed at ensuring heterogeneity and representation of various socio- economic and demographics characteristics. The selection of the KIs was facility-based and included the key people involved in the implementation of the Community Health Strategy in the sub-counties. Data collection tools A semi-structured guide based on the key themes of the study was used to conduct the interviews in the months of March\u2013April 2019. The key themes of the study which included the barriers and facilitators of the uptake of screening were included in the guide. Internal validity and reliability Lincoln and Guba criteria were used for enhancing trustworthiness. Several debriefing sessions were held by the research team members, who used multiple coders ensuring consensus from the team members before the generation of themes. Referential adequacy was ensured by a review of the original data and findings by two members of the research team who had vast experience in qualitative data analysis and multiple reviews of the data by other research team members before generation of codes to ensure the credibility of the data. Operationalization was also done through member checking at the end of interviews and keeping an audit trail of all the steps undertaken during analysis to ensure rigor. Researcher and methodological triangulation was also done (12). BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO UPTAKE OF PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING The ANNALS of AFRICAN SURGERY| www.annalsofafricansurgery.com 132 July 2021 | Volume 18 | Issue 3 Data collection procedure We conducted six FGDs which consisted of 59 community members and seven individual in-depth interviews with KIs and achieved saturation with a total of 66 participants. Each FGD was made up of the principal investigator and two research assistants. The FGD was conducted in a private set-up within the linked health facilities at the study site. The FGD was made up of nine to eleven participants. The average duration was 82 minutes. The KI interviews lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. All the interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Ethical approval The study was approved by the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology Institutional Ethics Review Committee (JKU/2/4/896B), the National Council of Science and Technology (NACOSTI P/19/71673/28322) and the Ministry of Health. Participant\u2019s autonomy and privacy were maintained throughout the study and written consent was sought following the explanation of the purposes, benefits, risks, and ground rules of the session by the moderator. Data analysis The study applied inductive thematic analysis. The transcripts underwent de-identification of participants with codes. The research team immersed themselves in the data to enhance familiarization and triangulation of the data. The data was then coded independently by two researchers using the grounded theory (12). The final codes were generated based on consensus from the research team which included experienced researchers. The coding entailed the analysis of specific statements and their categorization into themes. This was followed by searching for the themes and researcher triangulation coupled with the diagrammatic representation of the connection of themes for further interrogation. Then a review of the themes and sub-themes was done and comparison with the raw data and the transcripts was done multiple times before the generation of codes. The main themes were then named and defined through consensus of the research team members and consultation of two experts in the subject. This was followed by the final analysis of the data using the established themes. The six steps of data analysis as guided by Braun and Clarke were applied in the study (12). The analysis also embedded some direct quotations of the participants to reflect their opinions. Results The socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents are presented in Table 1. Table 1.

Facilitators to uptake of PC screening Four themes emerged as facilitators of PC screening which included experience of symptoms, proximity and prominence of cancer, accessibility of screening services and community advocacy as presented in Table 2. MBUGUA ET AL. July 2021 | Volume 18 | Issue 3 133 The ANNALS of AFRICAN SURGERY| www.annalsofafricansurgery.com Table 2. Facilitators to uptake of screening THEMES SUB-THEMES Accessibility of screening services Provision of free screening Inclusion of screening in National Health Insurance Provision of screening services in the peripheral facilities Inclusion in medical camps Experience of symptoms Presence of symptoms Proximity and prominence of cancer Death of family member/friend/community member Witnessing bad experiences of a relative/friend/community member affected by prostate cancer Community advocacy on PC screening Awareness created in the community/medical camps/mass media Health care workers health education/recommendation Experience of symptoms: The respondents reported the experience of symptoms as a facilitator to the uptake of screening as stated, \u201cI was visiting the toilet all the time to pass urine, so I decided to go to hospital to get checked: The doctor recommended that I get screened for prostate cancer.\u201d Proximity and prominence of cancer: The experience of negative outcomes from PC among family members or friends and having a close person diagnosed with PC was reported by participants as a facilitator to the uptake of screening. A participant stated: \u201cI lost my friend recently who was very close to me from prostate cancer, so I decided to take up screening.\u201d Accessibility of screening services: The provision of free screening services which are available in peripheral health facilities and the inclusion of screening services in the National Health Insurance Fund was highlighted by the majority of the respondents as a facilitator of screening. A participant stated, \u201cIf the government provides these screening services for free, many men, including myself, might consider taking up the test.\u201d Advocacy on prostate cancer screening: The creating of awareness through various channels of communication in the community was highlighted by the participants as a motivator to the uptake of PC screening. \u201cI was informed about prostate cancer screening in church, and since I had also heard about it on the radio, I decided to go for the test.\u201d Barriers to uptake of PC screening Five themes emerged as barriers to the uptake of prostate cancer screening which included lack of knowledge, fatalistic beliefs, low perception of self- vulnerability, stigma, and male dominance factors as presented in Table 3. Lack of knowledge Lack of knowledge was reported by participants as a barrier to the uptake of screening. Myths and misconceptions also deterred the uptake of screening with the predominant cause of PC reported being the denial of conjugal rights as illustrated by one participant: \u201cThis disease is caused by lack of sex, so men don\u2019t want to go for screening because it will indicate their sexual life has a problem.\u201d Perception of fatalism towards PC Fatalistic beliefs were reported as a barrier to screening. The participants seemed to perceive a diagnosis of PC as a death sentence as expressed by a participant: \u201cWith cancer in the equation, the denominator is always death, I fear cancer more than any other disease.\u201d A key informant stated, \u201cIn the community people equate cancer to death, which has contributed to the majority of the men not undertaking screening and resulting in using herbal medication.

Barriers to uptake of PC screening THEMES SUB-THEMES Lack of knowledge and awareness Lack of knowledge on PC disease Lack of information on screening (where/methods/cost) Confusion of PC with being an \u201cold man\u2019s disease\u201d (BPH) Myths and misconceptions on etiology of prostate cancer (denial of conjugal rights) Perception of fatalism towards PC Pessimism towards PC Perception of death inevitability on diagnosis/death sentence Fear of a diagnosis of PC Low perception of self-vulnerability Consider themselves at low risk Lack of symptoms Male dominance factors Association of sickness with femininity Masculinity threatened by low sexual performance Secrecy among men Preference of older males for screening Stigma Social isolation due to shame Embarrassing disease associated with sexual changes Low perception of self-vulnerability Low perception of the risk of PC was reported as a barrier to the uptake of PC screening. One participant stated: \u201cI have not been screened since I believe that I cannot get this disease after all, I take lots of healthy juices and my marriage is okay, you know what I mean...\u201d A KI asserted, \u201cThe medical camps have seen a very low turn-out of men for cancer screening since the majority don\u2019t think they are at risk.\u201d Male dominance factors Male dominance factors emerged as barriers which included threatening of masculinity due to poor sexual performance, association of sickness with being female, and screening by older male clinicians. As reported by a participant: \u201cThere was a time there was a medical camp offering cancer screening in our village, and I did not see men going to be screened, most of these things are for women.\u201d Stigma associated with PC Stigma associated with PC was also cited as a barrier due to its association with sexual behavior. A participant stated: \u201cWho really wants to go for screening? It will be like you are informing other people of your inability to perform sexually, it\u2019s too shameful for any man.\u201d Discussion Our study identified several barriers and facilitators to the uptake of PC screening in a rural community in Kenya. Experience of symptoms, proximity and prominence of cancer, accessibility of screening services, and advocacy were reported as facilitators of screening similar to those reported in other studies (13, 14). Clinicians should engage at-risk men presenting with urinary symptoms in shared decision-making in line with the screening guidelines (3). The provision of affordable screening services and the inclusion of peripheral facilities can be explored to circumvent the barriers to accessibility of the services. Public health awareness on PC should be incorporated in routine care and reinforced in the community through a collaboration of clinicians and community-based health workers. In the study, lack of knowledge on PC was reported as a major barrier to uptake of screening. This finding is corroborated with studies conducted among men in the Sub-Saharan African region and Kenya (8, 9, 15). Participation of men in screening is highly dependent on their knowledge about PC and the benefits of early detection. Low perception of self-vulnerability to PC reported among this at-risk population has been reported in previous studies (16\u201318). Perception of self- MBUGUA ET AL. July 2021 | Volume 18 | Issue 3 135 The ANNALS of AFRICAN SURGERY| www.annalsofafricansurgery.com vulnerability is critical in enhancing the uptake of screening (19). Targeted programs involving clinicians to reach at-risk men to enhance PC awareness and risk perception in the health care facilities and communities are urgently required. Fatalistic beliefs reported as barriers to screening in our study have been reported previously (9, 20). Fatalism is mainly attributed to a lack of knowledge and negative outcomes of PC (21). Clinicians can overcome these fatalistic beliefs through education of at-risk men, timely diagnosis and navigation of patients which will contribute towards improvement in PC treatment outcomes (20, 22). The male dominance factors reported in the study have been documented in previous studies (14, 23, 24). The preference of provision of screening services by older men was reported in the study. This can be explored by capacity building of male clinicians and inclusion of lower cadres like male nurses for provision of culturally acceptable screening services. Clinician recommendation is fundamental in PC decision-making processes. Evidence shows that low PC screening is associated with weak physician recommendation (25). An important question given our results is the involvement of clinicians in awareness creation and recommendation of screening to at-risk men. A study conducted in Kenya reported that only 10% of the screened men had a recommendation from a health care provider while a majority were not involved in decision-making (7). The need for sensitization of all clinicians on the current screening guidelines cannot be over emphasized. The study recommends the development of decision aids to enhance informed decision-making among men and to facilitate the implementation of shared decision-making process among clinicians. Conclusion The study identified several barriers and facilitators to PC screening. Lack of knowledge remains a major barrier to screening as it contributes to myths and misconceptions, low perception of self-vulnerability, and negative beliefs. There is a need for targeted programs involving clinicians to reach at-risk men to enhance public awareness on PC. Integration of culturally sensitive education to regular care should be adopted. Capacity building of clinicians, task shifting, and provision of well-coordinated affordable screening services in peripheral facilities should be explored. The concerted effort among policy makers and all health care workers to overcome the stated barriers to screening is highly recommended. Strengths and limitations The strength of the study includes the use of multiple methods of data collection that enhanced the validity of the study. However, the selection of participants was purposive sampling. Nevertheless, the researchers ensured heterogeneity in regard to socio-economic and demographic characteristics and stratification using the CUs while the KIs were multi-disciplinary. The participants were from a rural community, and hence the results may not be entirely generalized to urban communities. References 1. World Health Organization.

This retrospective report details the cases of 12 patients with earlobe clefts, only 1 of which was a congenital cleft, managed at a teaching hospital in Abuja, Nigeria, over 18 months. Nine patients in this series were children \u22642 years of age, and 3 were adults in their 20s or 30s. Eight patients presented with pressure necrosis from gold-plated stud earrings, and 3 patients had traction injuries from hoop earrings. According to the Blanco-D\u00e1vila and V\u00e1sconez classification system, 1 patient had a type I cleft, 6 patients had type II clefts, and 5 patients had type III clefts. The corrective techniques employed were the Pardue method (n=2), Z-plasty (n=5), and a combination (n=5) of the Pardue and Z-plasty methods. Immediate surgical outcomes were favourable; however, all patients were lost to follow-up. Keywords: cleft earlobe, pressure necrosis, earlobe repair, Nigeria Introduction B ody piercing, a method of body adornment well rec\u00ad ognized since antiquity,[1],[2] is most commonly seen in the form of earlobe piercing. This procedure, although widespread, is not without potential complications, includ\u00ad ing some that are life-threatening.[3] Acquired cleft earlobe is an uncommon complication of ear piercing,[4],[5] but its incidence has increased as the practice of ear piercing has continued to be fashionable.[6],[7] Acquired cleft of the ear\u00ad lobe is commonly caused by sudden traction on the earlobe or the wearing of heavy earrings.[6] Pressure necrosis has rarely been reported as a cause of cleft earlobe.[8]-[10] Nna\u00ad dozie et al.[8] alluded to aseptic ear-piercing practices being the primary cause of cleft earlobe secondary to necrotizing soft tissue infection. A cross-sectional survey conducted by Gabriel et al.[5] determined a low incidence of infection (13.4%) and cleft earlobes (8.5%) as complications of earlobe piercing, though the majority of their respondents had their ears pierced at home with no specific attention to asepsis. Most patients present as chronic cases,[6] though some may present as acute cases.[5] Acquired cleft of the earlobe is classified as complete or incomplete, each of which could be unilateral or bilat\u00ad eral, as per the classification outlined by Blanco-D\u00e1vila and V\u00e1sconez.[7] Complete tears usually result from sud\u00ad den traction on the earlobe, while partial tears are more common in older women due to the chronic use of heavy earrings.[11],[12] Clefts of the earlobe are further subclassi\u00ad fied into 3 types: type I (boundaries of the cleft hole extend\u00ad ing less than half the distance between the original piercing and the inferior margin of the earlobe), type II (boundaries of the cleft hole extending more than half the distance), and type III (also known as complete cleft of the earlobe) where the cleft hole completely splits the earlobe.[11],[13] Various methods of repair have been described for the various grades from ancient times[1],[11] to many other methods by recent authors.[3],[6]-[11] The repair methods are classified into straight-line or broken-line repair.[14] Most of these are fraught with recurrence or cosmetic dis\u00ad satisfaction.[6],[15] We report 12 patients with acquired cleft earlobe who were operated on in our plastic surgery unit.

Abubakar (amina.abubakar@uniabuja.edu.ng) EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022 145 journal.cosecsa.org Cleft earlobe repair in Abuja, Nigeria Case Series Methods In this retrospective review of patient records, data were col\u00ad lected for all patients who underwent surgical repair for cleft earlobes during an 18-month period. Three repair techniques were employed in the report\u00ad ed cases. The first, known as Pardue repair, is a straight- line method involving the excision of the cleft margins while preserving a small transpositional flap to facilitate the recreation of an earring hole at the time of the repair (Figure\u00a01).[16] The second technique, a broken-line repair, is similar to the first but incorporates a Z-plasty, as described by Hamilton and LaRossa (Figure 2).[17] The final technique consists of Z-plasties alone, with ear piercing performed at a subsequent appointment, a method introduced by Harahap (Figure 3).[18] Results During the 18-month period, 12 ear clefts were repaired. The patients\u2019 ages ranged from 9 months to 37 years, with 9 of the repairs performed on children \u22642 years of age (Table). The incidence of cleft earlobes was evenly distributed be\u00ad tween the left and right ears. All cases were acquired, with the exception of 1 con\u00ad genital cleft. The most prevalent cause was pressure necrosis from stud earrings (n=8), followed by traction injury from hoop earrings (n=3). Notably, all instances of pressure ne\u00ad crosis occurred in children. According to the Blanco-D\u00e1vila and V\u00e1sconez classifica\u00ad tion, type II clefts (n=6) were the most common, followed by type III (n=5), then 1 type I (n=1). All patients with pressure necrosis had experienced 72 hours of oedema, and dark patches were observed by the car\u00ad egivers before the cleft earlobes were noticed. Pardue repair alone was performed on 2 of the patients, while Z-plasty was used for 5 of the repairs, and a combi\u00ad nation of Pardue repair and Z-plasty was applied to the other 5 cases. Table 1.

Discussion The cleft earlobe is typically classified as either congenital or acquired.[6],[19] While acquired cleft earlobes predomi\u00ad nantly occur in adults,[7] our series revealed a higher inci\u00ad dence among children under 2 years of age. Earlobe piercing is commonly performed in infancy in our context. Gabriel et al.[5] found that 66% of respondents pierced their children\u2019s earlobes within the first 4 weeks of life. This was similarly reported by Haboor and El Mustafa.[3] Although the usual causes of cleft ear lobe are traction and gravity,[6],[7] our se\u00ad ries identified a rarer cause: pressure necrosis from stud ear\u00ad rings. Pressure necrosis as a cause of acquired cleft earlobe was initially reported by McLaren[9], as well as Wallace and Garretts,[10] as a complication of earrings with spring clips, which, like stud earrings, can exert excessive pressure on the earlobes.[20] More recently, Nnadozie et al.[8] described ne\u00ad crotizing fasciitis secondary to non-aseptic ear piercing as a probable pathophysiological mechanism. Gabriel et al.[5] found that only 6% of their participants used a piercing gun, while 71% used stud earrings, and 23% used a needle and thread for piercing.[5] The earlobe\u2019s anatomy, comprising skin, fibrofatty tissue, end arteries, and nerve endings,[21] may elucidate why excessive pressure from stud earrings can result in pressure necrosis. The fact that all the affected children were \u22642 years old might explain why the parents did not notice the pain. As Gabriel et al.[5] found, many parents believe that children of this age group are not aware of pain in their earlobes. Nnadozie et al.[8] also observed that their patients did not display discomfort until swelling and dark patches on the earlobes were seen by the moth\u00ad ers. As with our series, there was an absence of discharge or systemic symptoms. In our series, 5 patients (42%) were adults with type III injuries, which corroborates the findings reported by Has\u00ad sen,[12] whose series included 24 cleft earlobe repairs and 11 adults who underwent procedures for complete clefts (46%).

Furthermore, adhe\u00ad sive earlobe support patches, made of transparent plastic and claimed to prevent earlobe stretching and tearing, are commercially available; however, their effectiveness seems to lack supporting scientific evidence. All children in our series underwent repair under general anaesthesia, with the repair method being a combination of Pardue and Z- plasty, as described by Hamilton and LaRossa,[17] elimi\u00ad nating the need for subsequent ear-piercing. For patients with thinned earlobes, multiple Z-plasties were employed, and ear piercing was performed at a later date. Patients with type I cleft earlobes underwent Pardue repair.[16] The outcomes were satisfactory to the surgeons, patients, and parents, but all patients were lost to follow-up, preventing long-term assessment. One of the main complications of repiercing the earlobe is cleft recurrence, which we did not encounter in our series. This aligns with the report by Lane and O\u2019Toole,[23] who also noted a high rate of loss to follow-up. Conclusions The practice of ear piercing is common in Africa; however, to our knowledge, no previously published reports have de\u00ad scribed pressure necrosis as a complication affecting patients in Africa. Although ear piercing is predominantly performed by nonmedical professionals, it is crucial to establish guide\u00ad lines to prevent and mitigate the potential complications. The mechanisms underlying pressure necrosis warrant further in\u00ad vestigation, and parents should be educated to recognize early symptoms to prevent earlobe clefts and other complications.

The stan\u00ad dard treatment of choice is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt; however, complications associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement have been documented in the literature. Herein, we present a rare case of distal shunt migration with associated complications. Keywords: hydrocephalus, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, hydrothorax, hydrocele, Tanzania Introduction H ydrocephalus is among the leading causes of hospital admissions for infants in sub-Saharan Africa.[1]-[4] The standard treatment of choice is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS), and the recent decade has seen the introduc\u00ad tion of endoscopic third ventriculostomy as an efficient al\u00ad ternative in sub-Saharan Africa.[5] However, while VPS is the most common procedure conducted in the management of hydrocephalus, there is growing scientific evidence that complications of VPS may occur anywhere along the surgi\u00ad cal tract, from the ventricular system to its blind destination within the peritoneal cavity.[6]-[12] Herein, we review a rare case of double shunting, which was complicated by distal mi\u00ad gration; we discuss the course of management. Furthermore, consonant with the clinical picture, we briefly review similar cases reported in the literature. Case presentation We present the case of a 4-year-old boy who was admitted to our paediatric ward in September 2019 with a main complaint of severe respiratory distress for 4 days, which was associated with fevers and generalized body weakness. The patient was noted to have undergone a right-sided VPS procedure about 6 months earlier, in February 2019, due to a nonfunctional left-sided VPS that had been primarily placed in April 2018 for the treatment of congenital communicating hydrocepha\u00ad lus, diagnosed via computed tomography (CT) when the pa\u00ad tient was 2 years old. Our review of the operative notes from the previous procedures revealed no documented difficulties during either of the VPS operations. Similarly, a review of the past medical history, including admission notes and oral history obtained from the parents prior to the procedures, showed no recorded evidence of hernia before shunting. The patient had been under post-VPS management at our insti\u00ad tution for 8 months prior to this admission, with a reported history of intermittent, painless scrotal swelling persisting for more than 3 weeks. Upon admission, the child was tachyp\u00ad noeic with chest indrawing and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. He was febrile with a body temperature of 37.9\u00a0\u00b0C, had a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, and had nor\u00ad mal capillary refill. He was irritable but remained conscious and responsive to verbal commands. A thorough physical ex\u00ad amination revealed that the patient was notably underweight for his age. He had bilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunts, both palpable from the occipitoparietal points and trace\u00ad able along the trunk to the abdomen. The scrotum appeared swollen and was soft, mobile, retractable, and nontender. EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022 149 journal.cosecsa.org Mwanza, Tanzania: Distal migration of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt Case Report Investigations The initial full blood count (FBC) indicated leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, and the malaria test re\u00ad turned negative. The electrolyte panel, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and urinalysis all fell within nor\u00ad mal ranges. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from shunt tapping showed no abnormalities. A chest x-ray (Figure\u00a01) displayed bilateral pleural effusions, notably more pronounced on the right side. Abdominopelvic ultrasonog\u00ad raphy detected a hydrocele and a potential right inguinal hernia, along with 2 VPS tubes present within the peritoneal cavity; the tip of the left-sided shunt was near the epigastric region. Abdominal ultrasonography was conducted to pre\u00ad cisely locate the distal ends of both shunt catheters, and this revealed the left-sided tip in the lower peritoneal area and the right tip in the epigastric area, both demonstrating active CSF flow when the shunt valve was compressed Differential diagnosis Based on the above investigations, we established provi\u00ad sional diagnoses of possible shunt migration to the pleural cavity, bacterial pneumonia with respiratory distress syn\u00ad drome, and a hydrocele secondary to an inguinal hernia. Differential diagnoses included shunt fracture, shunt over\u00ad drainage, and aspiration pneumonia, among other causes of respiratory distress. Management The patient received intravenous antipyretics and antibiotics and was placed on an oxygen mask, which led to improved oxygen saturation and resolved his fever. Following a consul\u00ad tation, the cardiothoracic team placed a chest drain for the right-sided pleural effusion, resulting in improved dyspnoea over 5 days. Beta-2 transferrin, a marker for CSF, was detect\u00ad ed in the sampled pleural fluid, supporting the diagnosis of CSF hydrothorax. The neurosurgical team was consulted and found both shunt valves to be functional; however, the possi\u00ad bility of migration to the pleural space and shunt overdrain\u00ad age was considered. The decision to remove the right-sided shunt was made because of the suspected overdrainage from both functioning shunts, a determination reached without the benefit of a preoperative CT scan of the head. Intraop\u00ad eratively, the distal portion of the left-sided shunt, which was surgically truncated, was found near the pleura; however, no definite tract to the pleural cavity was identified. In the days following shunt removal, there was a notable reduction in the hydrocele and a progressive alleviation of the respira\u00ad tory distress. Further CSF analysis did not detect bacterial growth, effectively ruling out bacterial ventriculitis. A CT scan of the brain, performed 5 days after external ventricular drainage, displayed ventriculomegaly indicative of increased intracranial pressure. This finding prompted the placement of a VPS, which was decided upon after a third consecutive negative CSF culture result. Outcome and follow-up A chest x-ray performed 7 days after the chest drain inser\u00ad tion showed complete resolution of the pleural effusion. On the first day following the VPS procedure, a control CT scan of the brain (Figure\u00a02) confirmed the shunt\u2019s correct place\u00ad ment without evidence of increased intracranial pressure. Nonetheless, 3 days after the procedure, the patient\u2019s mother observed intermittent scrotal swelling, and the child\u2019s res\u00ad piratory distress returned, even while he was receiving high- flow oxygen therapy. The patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, Figure 1. Chest x-ray showing a bilateral pleural effusion on admission Figure 2.

The patient died within 7 days following the VPS procedure, potentially due to severe pneumonia related to hydrothorax or aspiration pneumonia, compounded by pro\u00ad longed immobilization. Shunt functionality was assessed and deemed operational, which discounted shunt failure as a cause of death. Despite aggressive treatment with high- dose intravenous antibiotics and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, the patient succumbed to what was presumed to be severe pneumonia, characterized by severe respiratory distress. An autopsy was not conducted to con\u00ad clusively determine the cause of death due to a lack of con\u00ad sent from the patient\u2019s family. Discussion Distal shunt migration is among the most commonly re\u00ad ported complications of VPS placement.[13]-[16] In this article, we describe a patient with 2 simultaneous complica\u00ad tions of a VPS: left-sided distal migration into the pleural space and distal migration into the scrotum, leading to hy\u00ad drothorax and hydrocele, respectively. Several authors have identified hydrothorax as a potential VPS complication, with varied management outcomes in both paediatric and adult patients.[17]-[21] Martin et al.[17] suggest that intra-abdom\u00ad inal migration of the catheter through the right costoverte\u00ad bral trigone of Bochdalek could be the mechanism behind hydrothorax formation.[17] In our case, we hypothesize that the truncated sharp end of the left-sided shunt inadvertently pierced the pleura, permitting the free flow of CSF into the pleural cavity and thus causing hydrothorax. For the recurrent hydrocele observed in our patient, we propose that it was due to a congenital inguinal hernia that allowed positional leakage of CSF from the peritoneal cavity into the scrotum. A case report by Paterson and Ferch de\u00ad scribes the effective resolution of a similar case of recurrent migration via shortening of the distal catheter.[22] Nawaz et al.[23] adopted a different treatment strategy for a patient with scrotal shunt migration, involving bilateral herniotomy, left-sided orchidopexy, and repositioning of the VPS into the peritoneal cavity in a 6-month-old with a recurring right hydrocele. Regrettably, in our case, the patient died from on\u00ad going respiratory distress before additional surgery could be offered to address the hernia. Conclusions Hydrothorax, although infrequent, is a potentially fatal com\u00ad plication of VPS surgery and must be considered in any pa\u00ad tient with a VPS presenting with severe respiratory distress. Prompt recognition and intervention of VPS migration, es\u00ad pecially when it results in hydrothorax, are crucial to prevent dire outcomes. Additionally, recurrent hydrocele secondary to hernia formation typically necessitates surgical correction through herniotomy. The importance of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary team approach in managing such complex complications cannot be overstated.

Within this category, perianal TB is particularly rare, accounting for under 1% of gastrointestinal TB cases. This report details the presentation and successful treatment of a 35-year- old man with a chronic perianal fistula yielding persistent purulent discharge, which a biopsy confirmed as secondary to TB. Combined surgical and pharmacological management led to a successful resolution. This case emphasizes the importance of including TB in the differential diagnosis for persistent, complex perianal fistulas, especially in settings where TB prevalence is high. Keywords: complex fistula in ano, tuberculosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, Ethiopia Introduction T uberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in Africa.[1] Extrapulmonary presentations are infre\u00ad quent, with perianal TB constituting less than 1% of gas\u00ad trointestinal TB cases. Perianal TB may be misidentified as other inflammatory or granulomatous diseases and typically necessitates histological diagnosis and a high index of suspi\u00ad cion. There have been few case reports on the diagnosis and management of perianal TB. Case presentation History A 35-year-old man presented with 2 months of persistent pu\u00ad rulent drainage from a perianal wound. He had undergone 2 surgical interventions\u2014seton placement and fistulotomy\u2014 within the previous 18 months. The first operation, conducted at a district hospital, did not include a biopsy. The second op\u00ad eration involved the application of a seton to a fistulous tract and curettage of 2 draining sinuses, owing to the challenge of discerning the tracts\u2019 internal and external connections. Follow-up at our facility was inconsistent due to the patient missing several appointments. Notably, the discharge contin\u00ad ued unabated, with an additional fistulous tract developing, indicative of a lack of healing. The patient reported no altera\u00ad tion in bowel habits or abdominal discomfort and reported no symptoms such as cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, or loss of appetite. He also had no history of prior TB treatment. Physical examination He had a blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and body temperature of 36.8\u00a0\u00b0C. Systemic examination did not reveal any other abnormalities. The abdomen appeared flat and soft without organomegaly. Perianal examination re\u00ad vealed 4 pus-draining orifices and 1 healed scar (Figure 1). Digital rectal examination detected no masses; however, the perianal region was indurated, with palpable fibrous tracts forming a horseshoe pattern. Diagnostic investigations Abdominal ultrasonography and colonoscopy returned nor\u00ad mal results. HIV and diabetes mellitus tests were negative. A full blood count and organ function tests were within nor\u00ad mal ranges. The chest x-ray showed no pathological findings. Differential diagnosis The complexity and refractory nature of the fistulas prompted us to consider several primary diagnostic possibilities: Crohn\u2019s disease, complications from the use of traditional herbal rem\u00ad edies often applied for haemorrhoids or anal fissures in rural Ethiopia, and TB. We promptly ruled out malignancy and other common risk factors, including radiotherapy. We also explored and excluded additional risk factors for chronic, nonhealing wounds, such as undiagnosed collagen vascular disorders and immunosuppression from conditions like HIV or diabetes. EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022 153 journal.cosecsa.org Hawassa, Ethiopia: Tuberculous fistula in ano in a 35-year-old man Case Report Management Confronted with a complex, nonhealing fistula in ano, we performed an anal examination under anaesthesia. The ex\u00ad amination revealed 4 pus-draining external openings situ\u00ad ated at the left lateral, posterior midline, right lateral, and right anterior positions, arranged in a horseshoe configura\u00ad tion. Primary openings were identified at the posterior mid\u00ad line and right lateral positions. The fistula tracts, following a transsphincteric route, were curetted, and the tissue ob\u00ad tained was sent for histopathologic examination. A draining seton was placed (Figure 2). Outcome and follow-up The patient exhibited a favourable postoperative recovery and was discharged after 2 days. One month later, the histo\u00ad pathology results confirmed TB, characterized by granuloma formation and caseous necrosis (Figure 3, Figure 4). Draining setons were replaced with nylon sutures (Figure 5), and anti- TB drug therapy was initiated. Subsequent follow-up showed significant improvement; within 2 months, the perianal area had healed, allowing for the removal of the nylon seton. Figure 1.

Instances of perianal TB mimicking cancer are exceedingly rare.[11] In some instances, perianal TB may resolve with anti-TB treatment alone.[12] However, as previously discussed, a bi\u00ad opsy is generally necessary to confirm the diagnosis, often obtained through surgical intervention. Conclusions TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of non\u00ad healing perianal fistulas, particularly in geographical regions with high incidence rates. Combination drug therapy is cru\u00ad cial for effective treatment. Discussion This report describes a case of a chronic, nonhealing peri\u00ad anal fistula secondary to untreated TB, successfully managed with surgical intervention and appropriate drug therapy. According to the World Health Organization, TB is the ninth leading cause of death globally, and in 2017, there were an estimated 1.3 million TB-related deaths among HIV-negative individuals and an additional 300\u00a0000 deaths among people living with HIV. In Africa, TB continues to be a significant health challenge, with the World Health Or\u00ad ganization reporting an estimated incidence of 25\u00a0900 cases in a population of 1\u00a0020\u00a0000 in 2016.[1] Ethiopia remains a high-TB-burden country, with an incidence rate of 164 per 100\u00a0000 in 2017.[2] While the majority of TB cases affect the lungs, extrapul\u00ad monary manifestations, including lymphadenitis, pleural, skeletal, meningeal, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal TB, are well recognized.[3] Gastrointestinal TB accounts for 1% of extrapulmonary TB cases[4] and may arise from the in\u00ad gestion of infected sputum, consumption of contaminated food, haematogenous spread, or direct extension from ad\u00ad jacent organs. The ileocaecal region is the most commonly affected area, presenting as strictures, obstruction, fistulas, or perforation, with lesions being ulcerative, hypertrophic, or a combination of both.[3] Perianal TB, accounting for less than 1% of gastrointestinal TB cases, is particularly rare. It predominantly occurs alongside active pulmonary disease[5] and typically presents as haemorrhoids, perianal abscesses, or fistula in ano.[6] Nepomuceno et al.[7] iden\u00ad tified 4 types of perianal TB: ulcerative, verrucous, lupoid, and miliary, with ulcerative being the most common form, often secondary to pulmonary or intestinal lesions\u2014peria\u00ad nal disease is seldom primary.[7],[8] Anal fistula is the most frequent manifestation of perianal TB,[9] and differentiating tuberculous fistulas from those with other causes requires histologic or bacteriologic analysis. Crohn\u2019s disease is often considered in differential diagnoses due to symptomatic par\u00ad Figure 5. The setons were replaced by Nylon sutures. References 1. World Health Organization.

The management of older, frail patients with sigmoid volvulus and multiple comorbidities is challenging. Conservative treatment is preferred but is associated with a high recurrence rate. Based on insights from endemic regions, nonresectional surgical approaches are gaining traction. We propose a minimally inva\u00ad sive, nonresectional technique designed to mitigate the elevated risks associated with frail patients: laparoscopic plication and retroperitonealization of the sigmoid colon (PROSC). Two older adults with extensive comorbidities underwent laparoscopic PROSC for persistent or recurrent sigmoid volvulus. There were no procedural or postoperative complications. No recurrent volvulus, constipation, or infection was reported at a 12-month follow-up evaluation. These results show that laparoscopic PROSC could be an attractive and safe minimally invasive alternative technique for treating older, frail patients with (recurrent) sigmoid volvulus. The technique may be a superior alternative for treating nongangrenous sigmoid volvulus.

Case presentations Between September and December 2018, 2 patients were treated for recurrent or persistent sigmoid volvulus at the Department of Surgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, a large referral hospital in Enschede, the Netherlands. Written informed consent was obtained from both patients before the interventions. The operations were performed by highly experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Patients Patient 1, an 87-year-old White male with a past medi\u00ad cal history of Parkinson\u2019s disease, ileus, and recurrent sig\u00ad moid volvulus (ASA [American Society of Anesthesiolo\u00ad gists] physical status class II), was admitted with intestinal cramps, constipation, and a distended abdomen. There were no signs of peritonitis. An abdominal x-ray showed a new episode of sigmoid volvulus (Figure 1). Within 1 year, the pa\u00ad tient presented 3 times with recurrent sigmoid volvulus, for which detorsion and decompression were conducted each time by endoscopic decompression and a rectal tube. Elec\u00ad tive surgery was scheduled, but the patient presented for a fourth time with sigmoid volvulus before the elective surgery could be conducted. Detorsion and decompression were achieved by passage of a rectal tube once again, and subsequently, 3 days later, a laparoscopic PROSC was performed. Patient 2, an 85-year-old White male with a past medical history of constipation and ileus (ASA class III), presented to the emergency department with diarrhoea, (faecal) vomit\u00ad ing, and a distended abdomen. There were no signs of perito\u00ad nitis. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a sigmoid volvulus with an 11-cm dilatation. Detorsion and decompression were achieved by endo\u00ad scopic decompression and rectal tube insertion. Initially, the patient improved clinically, but his symptoms returned after 3 days. Subsequent computed tomography revealed a recur\u00ad rent sigmoid volvulus (Figure 2). Laparoscopic PROSC was performed on the same day. Figure 1. Abdominal x-ray revealing sigmoid volvulus in patient 1 Significant distension of the sigmoid colon, measuring up to 18 cm, is displayed as an arc (cranial view). Both small and large intestinal loops appear distended. Figure 2. Imaging of recurrent sigmoid volvulus in patient 2 following failed conservative management with a rectal tube The (A) x-ray and (B) coronal-view computed tomography im\u00ad ages display the coffee bean sign, indicative of a closed loop of the distended sigmoid colon filled with gas. This sign is a classic radiographic finding signifying sigmoid volvulus. No significant dilation of the small intestinal loops, oedematous wall thicken\u00ad ing, or pneumatosis intestinalis is evident in these images. A B EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022 157 journal.cosecsa.org Laparoscopic sigmoid colon plication and retroperitonealization Case Report Management: laparoscopic PROSC procedure The patient is positioned in a modified lithotomy posi\u00ad tion with the legs supported by stirrups. The procedure is performed with the surgeon standing on the right side of the patient. Access to the peritoneal cavity is achieved by an open in\u00ad troduction technique: a paraumbilical incision is made, and a 10-mm trocar port is inserted, after which pneumoperito\u00ad neum (15 mmHg) is established. Two 5-mm ports are insert\u00ad ed in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen under direct visualization. If the colon is still distended, decompression is first achieved by inserting a rectal tube with proctoscopy. Then, the peritoneum must be dissected, lifting it off the (left) lateral abdominal wall, after which the sigmoid colon is mobilized retroperitoneally. The flaccid part of the sigmoid is placed retroperitoneally, and the peritoneal flap that has been raised is sutured to the antimesenteric taenia of the sig\u00ad moid colon with barbed suture (Figure 3). After thorough inspection of the sigmoid and confirmation that there are no complications, the trocars are removed un\u00ad der direct vision. Fascia is closed with 0-Vicryl sutures, and the skin is intracutaneously closed with 4-0 Monocryl su\u00ad tures. The rectal tube is left in situ for up to 4 days. Outcome and follow-up There were no procedural or postoperative complications in either of the patients. For patient 1, the time under anaesthesia was 66 minutes. He had normal bowel movements on the second postop\u00ad erative day when oral intake was started. Patient 1 was dis\u00ad charged on the fourth postoperative day. Patient 2 had a dolichosigmoid. Therefore, additional fixation of the tip of the dolichosigmoid with barbed su\u00ad ture to the left subcostal abdominal wall was performed. The time under anaesthesia was 52 minutes. He had normal bowel movements on the fourth postoperative day when oral intake was started. Patient 2 was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. At respective 12-month postoperative follow-up visits, neither patient had experienced complications\u2014such as re\u00ad current volvulus, constipation, or infection\u2014and none were detected by our evaluations. Discussion With the ageing population in the Western world, coupled with an increase in institutionalized patients and those with chronic constipation due to abundant opioid usage, a rise in the prevalence of sigmoid volvulus is expected. Managing older, frail patients presents a challenge. While surgery is the preferred option for preventing recurrence, as it is in younger patients, it also comes with a higher risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly when a sigmoid resection is performed.[2],[8],[9],[12] To miti\u00ad gate this risk, nonresectional operative procedures could be considered. In Malawi, where 1 of the authors previously worked, sigmoidopexy is the most common procedure used to treat nongangrenous volvulus, and it is associated with low recur\u00ad rence rates.[8] The principle of sigmoidopexy, used in this endemic region, is the foundation of laparoscopic PROSC, a minimally invasive alternative to sigmoidopexy. It is important to use nonabsorbable sutures to minimize the risk of recurrence. Studies have shown the use of absorb\u00ad able sutures to be associated with recurrent sigmoid volvu\u00ad lus, while recurrences have not yet been reported in associa\u00ad tion with the use of nonabsorbable sutures.[8] A major complication associated with fixation of the sigmoid colon to the abdominal wall is internal herniation.[13] This risk is averted by the mobilization of the sigmoid colon retroperitoneally. Although plication is an old technique that has been somewhat abandoned, the combination of minimally inva\u00ad sive plication with retroperitonealization of the colon is an attractive option for treating prefrail and frail patients. Successful results after nonresectional surgery have been reported widely.[1],[8],[10],[11] However, the most recent guidelines suggest that nonresectional operative procedures are inferior to sigmoid colectomy for the prevention of re\u00ad current volvulus.[14] Percutaneous endoscopic colostomy tube insertion is suggested for high-risk patients who are unfit for surgery.[14] These recommendations, however, are based on low-quality evidence.[15] Although laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic sigmoi\u00ad dopexy appears safer than standard percutaneous en\u00ad doscopic colostomy tube insertion, the former is associ\u00ad ated with significant complications, such as infection and faecal leakage.[6],[10] These risks are minimized with laparoscopic PROSC. If the sigmoid colon is not gangrenous, and there is an increased risk of anastomotic leakage, laparoscopic PROSC could be an attractive and safe minimally invasive alternative technique that minimizes the risk of recurrence and anas\u00ad tomotic leakage.[11] As such, this procedure is particularly useful in the management of older and frail or prefrail pa\u00ad tients, for whom sigmoid resection is a high-risk procedure.

Pelvic stress fractures constitute approximately 4% of all bone stress fractures. Athletes are particularly at risk for developing these types of fractures. Stress fractures of the pubic rami typically manifest as severe, progressively worsening pain in the groin area. A high index of suspicion and comprehensive clinical examination are essential for accurate diagnosis. Advanced imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, offer high sensitivity and can corroborate clinical findings. This report presents a case of a misdiagnosed pubic ramus stress fracture in an athlete. We also review the relevant literature and discuss diagnostic approaches and treatment recommendations for such patients.

Stress fractures of the pubic rami are the most common PSFs, largely attributable to the tensile force exerted by the strong adductor muscles at their pubic insertion. These fractures are frequently observed in long-distance runners.[1] The typical clinical presentation of PSFs is groin pain, and such fractures may not be evident on plain radiographs. Even repeated imaging findings may remain falsely negative.[2] More ad\u00ad vanced imaging modalities, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scintigraphy, are often necessary for definitive diagnosis. Given the relatively small number of reported cases worldwide, this specific case highlights the need for a height\u00ad ened index of suspicion among treating clinicians for this rare injury; it also highlights the absence of a standardized treatment protocol. We report a case of a pubic ramus stress fracture in a professional Ethiopian marathon runner. Case presentation A 25-year-old male professional marathon runner present\u00ad ed with lower abdominal and groin pain, which had been progressing over a span of 3 months by his estimation. He noted a significant increase in pain during the 2 weeks pre\u00ad ceding his presentation, which interfered with his training and daily activities. Despite seeking medical treatment, he experienced no improvement in his symptoms. The patient had no history of trauma, comorbid conditions, or chronic illnesses in the family. Additionally, he reported no history of smoking or alcohol consumption and had no other sites of pain. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness in the lower abdomen, inguinal area, and pubis, especially upon deep palpation. The only other significant finding was pain on adduction against resistance on the right side. PSF was the leading differential diagnosis, followed by a femoral neck stress fracture. The patient was subsequently referred for imaging studies. Plain radiographs displayed an indeterminate lesion on the right pubic body and mild wid\u00ad ening of the symphysis pubis. Due to the inconclusive nature of the radiograph, further imaging was ordered (Figure 1). Additional MRI revealed a nondisplaced inferomedial frac\u00ad ture of the right pubic body at the insertion of the common aponeurosis of the rectus abdominis and adductor longus muscles, as well as adjacent ill-defined bone marrow oedema on the superior pubic ramus. There was also a partial tear of the rectus abdominis\u2013adductor longus aponeurosis, accom\u00ad EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023 43 journal.cosecsa.org Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Pubic ramus stress fracture in a marathon runner Case Report panied by subchondral bone marrow oedema of the pubic symphysis, consistent with pubic symphysitis (Figure 2). The patient was treated conservatively through rest, an\u00ad algesic medication, and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D. After 3 months of this regimen, he returned to training without pain. Discussion BSFs arise from physiological, cyclical, repetitive, and con\u00ad tinuous muscular forces exerted on normal bones, leading to microtrauma that is inadequately remodelled.[3],[4] These fractures are commonly observed in otherwise healthy peo\u00ad ple, such as military personnel and athletes. Frequent sites for these fatigue fractures include the tibia, distal fibula, and metatarsals. BSFs can be categorized as high risk or low risk based on their likelihood for progression, delayed union, or nonunion. PSFs can be attributed to a variety of contributing fac\u00ad tors, both extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic factors include nutritional habits, type of terrain, and sports regimens, while intrinsic factors include anatomical variations, age, sex, eth\u00ad nicity, body mass index, bone mineral density, and physical fitness levels.[3] These factors often intersect in complex ways.[5] For example, a case-control study conducted at an institutional sports injury clinic in South Africa in 1990 found that athletes with BSFs were more likely than those without fractures to experience menstrual irregularities (P<0.005). That study also noted lower levels of dietary cal\u00ad cium intake in the fracture group (P=0.02).[6] Furthermore, a randomized, double-blind study found that vitamin D and calcium supplementation reduced the risk of fractures.[7] Women are more prone to such injuries, as substantiated by multiple studies, due to physiological factors like lower aero\u00ad Figure 2. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis, with (A) Axial PD fatsat (proton-density fat saturation), (B) coronal STIR (short TI inversion recovery), and (C) sagittal PD fatsat sequences These images revealed a nondisplaced fracture of the right inferomedial pubic body at the insertion of the common aponeurosis of the rectus abdominis and adductor longus mus\u00ad cles. Ill-defined bone marrow oedema was also evident at the adjacent superior public ramus. There was also a partial tear of the rectus abdominis\u2013adductor longus aponeurosis, as well as symphysis pubis subchondral bone marrow oedema, consistent with symphysitis pubis. Figure 1.

Common symptoms include pain in the groin or thigh, as well as lower back and buttock discomfort.[5] Differential diagnoses for groin pain include inguinal hernia, adductor muscle inju\u00ad ry, osteitis pubis, pubic symphysitis, stress fractures of the pubic ramus or femoral neck, femoral acetabular impinge\u00ad ment, and hamstring injury.[8] It is crucial to differentiate these from femoral neck stress fractures, which may present similarly but are categorized as high-risk fractures.[4] In the context of a pubic ramus fracture, physical examination commonly reveals tenderness over the affected ramus upon deep palpation.[13] Pain may also be elicited when the pa\u00ad tient stands on a single leg on the affected side.[14] In terms of diagnostic imaging, advanced modalities are preferable for identifying pubic ramus stress fractures, as is the case for other PSFs. Plain radiographs, although readily available, have low sensitivity\u2014about 10% within the first 2 to 3 weeks.[15] Computed tomography is not recommended as the first line of imaging because of its low sensitivity and associated higher levels of radiation exposure. Bone scintig\u00ad raphy has high sensitivity but may yield false-positive results in the presence of a tumour or infection. MRI is the preferred modality; despite limitations related to cost and accessibility, it offers the advantage of high sensitivity without the risk of radiation exposure.[14],[16] MRI is also employed for classifying BSFs. The Frederich classification, originally developed for tibial stress fractures, has been extended to categorize other types of BSFs. This system consists of 4 grades and is useful for distinguishing fractures as either high risk or low risk.[15] Our patient\u2019s plain radiograph yielded inconclusive find\u00ad ings, which was consistent with existing literature. The de\u00ad finitive diagnosis was established using MRI. It should be noted that MRI for such injuries can reveal associated mus\u00ad cle contusions or injuries.[17] Our patient had sustained a tear in the common aponeurosis of the rectus abdominis and adductor longus muscles. The treatment regimen for PSFs, generally considered low-risk fractures, is usually relatively simple. The time frame for return to activity ranges from 7 to 12 weeks. Al\u00ad though conservative treatment is most commonly employed, surgical management may be considered based on the pa\u00ad tient\u2019s extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors. Addressing these risk factors can enhance the rehabilitation plan and diminish the likelihood of recurrence.[1],[13] A 2-phase rehabilitation protocol for conservative BSF management in athletes has been proposed (Table).[18],[19] While these guidelines serve as a general framework, the treating clinician should tailor the regimen based on the pa\u00ad tient\u2019s specific symptoms.[20] There is a knowledge gap con\u00ad cerning such treatment regimens in our context, making the timeline for return to activity somewhat arbitrary. Moreover, it is crucial to adjust contributing intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which are patient dependent. Recom\u00ad mendations exist for the administration of 1500 to 2000 mg of calcium and 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D as preventive measures against stress fractures, although the supporting literature is limited.[13],[21] Our patient received supple\u00ad mentation with both calcium and vitamin D. Summary and conclusions PSFs are uncommon but are more likely to be experienced by populations exposed to high levels of physical activity, such as athletes and military personnel. Our patient is a professional marathon runner who had been experiencing pain for 3 months before presenting to our clinic. Despite previous evaluations and the administration of analgesics for pain management, his condition was undiagnosed. This case underscores the need for orthopaedic surgeons to main\u00ad tain a high index of suspicion for PSFs in specific patient populations. MRI is the preferred diagnostic modality for confirming the clinical suspicion of PSFs. We acknowledge that access to MRI may be limited in certain situations; in such cases, a thorough physical examination, coupled with a detailed history and consideration of both extrinsic and in\u00ad trinsic risk factors, may offer the best diagnostic approach. Additionally, it is advisable to first rule out other more com\u00ad mon conditions and high-risk BSFs in the peripelvic region. In conclusion, evaluating the prevalence and under\u00ad standing of the associated extrinsic and intrinsic factors of PSFs and BSFs among athletes in our region would facili\u00ad tate the development of evidence-based treatment protocols. These protocols would incorporate risk factor modification Table.

It presents with cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We managed a 3-year-and-5-month-old boy with heterotaxy, who presented with bilious emesis, abdominal pain, distension, and obstipation. After resuscitation and nasogastric tube placement, an upright abdominal x-ray revealed a distended, right-sid\u00ad ed stomach with an air\u2013fluid level. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed this finding and revealed a midline liver, left-sided gall\u00ad bladder, shortened large bowel, and internal herniation. Initial surgery reduced the small bowel and pexyed the large bowel to the right. The patient presented with obstructive symptoms 14 days after discharge, requiring a duodenojejunostomy to bypass an annular pancreas. Heterotaxy is a rare condition with variable anatomical presentations that may cause obstructive symp\u00ad toms, often requiring surgical intervention. These cases can be complex, especially due to the potential for multiple coexisting sources of obstruction.

Sherif (sherif@bcm.edu) Introduction H eterotaxy syndrome is a disorder of embryonic de\u00ad velopment resulting in anomalous thoracoabdomi\u00ad nal organ determination of the left-right axis.[1] The clini\u00ad cal manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome include cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities.[2] Much of the literature on heterotaxy syndrome focuses on the cardiac sequelae, given the potentially life-threatening nature of the cardiac defects and the potential need for immediate, complex medical and surgical care.[3],[4] Extracardiac manifestations contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and occur in a con\u00ad siderable percentage of heterotaxy syndrome patients.[5] Recent publications concerning the extracardiac features of heterotaxy syndrome have attempted to further character\u00ad ize the syndrome and prepare physicians for its treatment or surgical management. A subset of the literature focuses on the intra-abdominal extracardiac manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome. This literature has described asplenia, polysplenia, midline liver, extrahepatic biliary atresia and hypoplasia, pancreatic ab\u00ad normalities, oesophageal atresia, hiatal and diaphragmatic hernias, right-sided stomach, bowel atresia, and malrotation of the intestine.[1],[6]-[9] These abdominal abnormalities can be asymptomatic or present with obstructive symptoms, oral intolerance, or abdominal discomfort. These symptoms depend, in part, on the degree and type of anatomic abnor\u00ad mality. There is an active effort to characterize the appropri\u00ad ate approaches for screening, operating, and managing the abdominal manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome.[10]-[12]. We report a case of heterotaxy syndrome that consisted exclusively of abdominal manifestations presenting as ob\u00ad struction and requiring complex surgical care. This article reviews the presentation, management, and surgical consid\u00ad erations of abdominal heterotaxy syndrome in the context of intestinal obstruction. Case presentation Initial encounter A 3-year-and-5-month-old Malawian boy was referred to our tertiary care centre from a district hospital after 3 days of bilious, projectile emesis (approximately 6 episodes per day after oral intake), 4 days of obstipation, generalized ab\u00ad dominal pain, and abdominal distension. The patient was born via uncomplicated, spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 25-year-old mother who attended 5 antenatal care visits and took antenatal supplements and medications. He cried EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023 47 journal.cosecsa.org Lilongwe, Malawi: Abdominal heterotaxy syndrome Case Report upon delivery, was able to breastfeed shortly after delivery, and exhibited no birth defects. He went on to achieve normal developmental milestones and receive all immunizations on time. At 2 years and 8 months of age, he was admitted for tonic-clonic seizures in the context of a severe malaria infection. The child had not previously undergone any surgical procedures. The patient\u2019s family history was significant only for asth\u00ad ma and hypertension. When the patient presented to this tertiary care centre, there was no history of fever or jaundice. The patient was afebrile, tachycardic, and normotensive. On examination, he was lethargic with muscle wasting (weight of 14 kg, 25th percentile). His abdomen was distended with tender\u00ad ness across all 4 quadrants. There was no rebound tender\u00ad ness or guarding, bowel sounds were normal, and the rectal vault was empty. Initial management After resuscitation and nasogastric tube placement, he un\u00ad derwent an upright abdominal x-ray that revealed a distend\u00ad ed, right-sided stomach with an air\u2013fluid level (Figure 1). There were no echocardiographic abnormalities. The deci\u00ad sion was made to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy. There were several pertinent intraoperative findings. These included an obstruction at the duodenojejunal junction sec\u00ad ondary to adhesive bands, a proximal jejunal haematoma, an internal herniation of the small bowel behind the duo\u00ad denum, a right-sided stomach, midline liver, and left-sided gallbladder (Figure 2). Extensive adhesiolysis was performed to release the bands, the small bowel was reduced, and the large bowel was pexyed to the right abdominal wall to restore its correct anatomic position. The patient\u2019s postoperative course was unremarkable, and he progressed appropriately, tolerating a diet after 24 hours and passing flatus on postop\u00ad erative day 4. Following this uneventful recovery, the patient was discharged. Second encounter After 14 days, the patient returned to the emergency de\u00ad partment with projectile, bilious emesis. The patient had been vomiting for 3 days (2-4 times per day after ingestion of food). The emesis was accompanied by severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain that was relieved by squatting. The patient complained of constipation, averaging 1 stool every 3 days. On examination, he was alert and afebrile, with a nor\u00ad mal heart rate. However, his weight had dropped from 14 kg to 12.5 kg. His abdomen was slightly distended, soft, and nontender. The previous incision site had healed. His full blood count and basic metabolic panel were notable for Figure 1. An erect x-ray revealed a right-sided gastric bubble, which was confirmed by nasogastric intubation. Figure 2. (A) A right-sided stomach and (B) adhesive bands were observed intraoperatively. A B 48 EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023 journal.cosecsa.org Lilongwe, Malawi: Abdominal heterotaxy syndrome Case Report anaemia (haemoglobin, 10.9 g/dL), hyponatraemia (sodi\u00ad um, 125 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (potassium, 2.6 mmol/L), and hypochloraemia (chloride 76 mmol/L). An abdominal series showed an enlarged right-sided gastric bubble and air\u2013fluid levels in the stomach (Figure 3). A contrast study raised concerns for a proximal small bowel obstruction, as the contrast medium did not progress beyond the stomach after 10 minutes. Secondary intervention The patient underwent a second exploratory laparotomy, where the previously noted anatomical variants were noted (Figure 2), including an enlarged right-sided stomach, mid\u00ad line liver, left-sided gallbladder, and a left-sided duodenoje\u00ad junal junction with a broad mesentery. Additionally, a short\u00ad ened large bowel, a small right spleen, and a right-positioned pancreatic tail were observed. A significant finding during this operation was the presence of an annular pancreas en\u00ad circling and possibly obstructing the duodenum (Figure 4). To address these issues, adhesions were lysed, and the shortened large bowel was repositioned to the right side of the abdomen, with the caecum situated in the right upper quadrant. The procedure was completed with the construc\u00ad tion of a single-layer duodenojejunostomy using 4-0 PDS (polydioxanone sutures). Outcomes Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the paediatric high-dependency unit. His immediate postoperative course was characterized by poor urine output (<0.5 mL/kg/h) and suboptimal oxygen saturation levels (approximately 80%). After 72 hours, oxygen saturation and urine output normal\u00ad ized, and the child was transferred to the general ward. The patient received maintenance intravenous fluids for the first 4 days, then started sips of oral rehydration solution. He pro\u00ad gressed to clear liquids and eventually a full diet. The child was discharged with scheduled follow-up in the paediatric surgery clinic. At the 2-month visit, the patient was doing well and had gained weight. Discussion Increasingly, physicians are attempting to diagnose hetero\u00ad taxy syndrome in the prenatal setting via ultrasonographic detection and characterization of cardiac abnormalities.[13] Early detection, in turn, assists in the appropriate provision of prenatal counselling and timely medical care during the neonatal period. However, there has been evidence that het\u00ad erotaxy syndrome may occur with exclusively abdominal Figure 3. An abdominal series demonstrated significant gastric distension. The results at 0, 2, 5, and 10 minutes are pictured without any passage of contrast to the small bowel, suggesting a proximal obstruction. Figure 4. The patient\u2019s anatomic anomalies included a midline liver, right-sided stomach, left-sided gallbladder, diminutive spleen, annular pancreas, adhesive bands, widened mesentery, and short colon.

He exhibited only abdominal manifestations of the syndrome, including an enlarged right- sided stomach, midline liver, left-sided gallbladder, left-sided duodenum, left-sided duodenojejunal junction, broad small bowel mesentery, shortened large bowel, small spleen, and small pancreas. Abdominal heterotaxy syndrome, therefore, requires the paediatrician and the paediatric surgeon to be mindful of certain practice-based considerations. These considerations may include basic changes, such as the inclusion of heterotaxy syndrome in the differential di\u00ad agnosis when a patient presents with bowel obstruction, re\u00ad gardless of the age of presentation. However, more profound implications exist. For example, exclusively abdominal manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome in a resource-limited setting may influence the time to diagnosis and early perfor\u00ad mance of surgical treatment. Antenatal ultrasonography may be used as a screening tool to examine the abdominal organ arrangement.[15] However, there is much debate around the necessity of screening patients for abdominal manifesta\u00ad tions of heterotaxy and the subsequent decision to operate if any abnormalities are found.[12],[16]-[18] These choices in clinical practice are particularly important because, as illus\u00ad trated by this case, heterotaxy syndrome can lead to multi\u00ad ple sources of intra-abdominal bowel obstruction, including Ladd\u2019s bands, annular pancreas, malrotation, and herniation of the bowel. Conclusions Heterotaxy syndrome is a rare condition with a spectrum of presentations and anatomical variations. It is important for the paediatrician and the paediatric surgeon to be mindful of the abdominal manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome as they will guide their screening, surgical, and overall man\u00ad agement practices. These practice-based considerations are particularly important given the multiple possible causes of bowel obstruction and the potential for recurrent pres\u00ad entations. Reoperation on these patients can be challeng\u00ad ing, especially for surgeons not experienced with congenital bowel malposition. Acknowledgements: The authors thank Scott Holmes, CMI (Michael E.

Suga Myungsung Medical College and Department of Surgery, MCM Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Correspondence: Dr Aklilu Getachew (getake1715@gmail.com) Abstract Polyorchidism (also known as polyorchism) is a rare anomaly characterized by the presence of at least 1 supernumerary testis and is typically an incidental finding. Bilateral polyorchidism is particularly rare, with only 10 reported cases in the literature. Polyorchi\u00ad dism may be associated with a variety of complications, including malignancy. A 29-year-old man with a history of bone tuberculosis presented to our centre with a painless scrotal mass. The diagnosis of bilater\u00ad al polyorchidism with concurrent testicular tuberculosis was reached after comprehensive physical examination, imaging, biopsy, and exploratory surgery. The patient\u2019s testes were discovered to be in pairs, fused within both the right and left hemiscrotums. The management strategy consisted of tuberculosis medication and regular follow-up. Supernumerary testes may be found within or outside the scrotum. Ultrasonography is the preferred diagnostic modality. In the absence of complications or associated conditions, no further intervention is typically required. This case report expands our understanding of polyorchidism and outlines a comprehensive approach to patient management. Moreover, given the rarity of reported bilateral polyorchidism, this case provides further insights into this unusual medical condition. Keywords: polyorchidism, polyorchism, bilateral polyorchidism, supernumerary testes, testicular tuberculosis, Ethiopia Introduction P olyorchidism (also called polyorchism) is a rare con\u00ad genital anomaly characterized by the presence of 1 or more supernumerary testes. Just over 200 cases have been reported in the literature, and most were asymptomatic and discovered incidentally.[1] Triorchidism is the most preva\u00ad lent form, with 4 and 5 testes previously reported in 10 and a single patient, respectively, although the latter lacked his\u00ad tologic confirmation.[1] The additional testes are predomi\u00ad nantly found within the scrotum (75%), with the remainder discovered in the inguinal region (20%) or abdominally/ret\u00ad roperitoneally (5%).[1] We present a case of bilateral polyor\u00ad chidism in conjunction with testicular tuberculosis. Case presentation A 29-year-old man presented to our general medical hospi\u00ad tal in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with nontender bilateral scrotal swelling and a history of treated bone tuberculosis. Exami\u00ad nation revealed palpable testes of normal size and firm con\u00ad sistency in both the right and left hemiscrotums, with addi\u00ad tional, similarly sized and consistent masses also identified. Ultrasonographic examination revealed hypoechoic hemiscrotal masses measuring 5.7 cm \u00d7 3 cm (right) and 5.7 cm \u00d7 3.3 cm (left), following the epididymal outline and Figure 1. Ultrasonograms showing the right and left testes in the right and left hemiscrotums, respectively EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023 51 journal.cosecsa.org Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Bilateral polyorchidism and testicular TB Case Report displaying peripheral calcific foci (Figure 1, Figure 2). Fine- needle aspiration (FNA) cytologic examination confirmed the masses as testes, characterized by ill-formed epithelioid cell granulomas. Acid-fast bacilli detected in the sample in\u00ad dicated tuberculosis infection. Exploratory surgery through a midscrotal raphe incision revealed 2 fused testes of identical size and shape, sharing the same arteries, epididymis, and vas deferens within the right hemiscrotum (Figure 3). The left hemiscrotum was not explored, and both testes were returned to the scrotum. After extensive physical examination, imaging, FNA cy\u00ad tologic examination, and an exploratory procedure, a diag\u00ad nosis of bilateral polyorchidism with testicular tuberculosis was established. Discussion Polyorchidism, defined as the presence of more than 2 tes\u00ad tes in 1 person, is a rare condition typically discovered in\u00ad cidentally in patients between 15 and 25 years of age during surgery for cryptorchidism, testicular exploration, ingui\u00ad nal hernia, or testicular torsion.[2] The first histologically and surgically confirmed case was recorded by Arbuthnot Lane in 1895].[3],[4] The genesis of the testes occurs from the genital ridge of the mesoderm, giving rise to the gonads, duct\u00ad al system, and primordial germ cells. In genetic males, the TDF (testis-determining factor) triggers gender determination.[5] Also referred to as the SRY (sex-determin\u00ad ing region of the Y chromosome), the TDF is located on the Y chromosome\u2019s short arm (Yp11). It transforms the primitive gonads into testes, which subsequently produce testosterone, prompting growth of the mesonephric (wolffian) ducts.[6] The wolffian duct, a primordial urogenital tissue, contributes to the formation of the epididymides, vasa deferentia, semi\u00ad nal vesicles, and common ejaculatory duct following male sex determination.[7] Among polyorchidism cases, triorchidism is the most common. The specific pathogenetic mechanisms under\u00ad lying polyorchidism remain elusive, but several theories propose mechanisms, including duplication of the geni\u00ad tal ridge, as well as longitudinal or transverse division of the genital ridge. Leung and Singer have further suggested a classification of embryologic polyorchidism based on embryologic differentiation [1]: \u2022 Type A: The supernumerary testis lacks an epididymis or vas deferens and is unattached to the normally situated testes. \u2022 Type B: The supernumerary testis drains into the epididymis of a normally situated testis and shares a common vas deferens. \u2022 Type C: The supernumerary testis has its own epididymis and vas deferens. \u2022 Type D: There is complete duplication of the tes\u00ad tes, epididymides, and vasa deferentia. According to this classification system, our patient had bilateral type B polyorchidism, with the additional testes at\u00ad tached together in both the right and left hemiscrotums and sharing common vasa deferentia, arterial supplies, and ve\u00ad nous drainage. Most people with polyorchidism present with painless testicular masses. Associated anomalies commonly include cryptorchidism (40%), inguinal hernia (30%), hydrocoele (9%), and testicular malignancy (6%).[8] Our patient\u2019s FNA results indicated testicular tuberculosis in the supernumer\u00ad ary right and left testes. Figure 2. Ultrasonogram of the left scrotum with the left testis and a hypoechoic adjacent mass Figure 3. Two right-sided testes fused together and sharing same epididymis and vas deferens 52 EAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023 journal.cosecsa.org Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Bilateral polyorchidism and testicular TB Case Report Ultrasonography is the primary diagnostic tool for poly\u00ad orchidism, with magnetic resonance imaging available for further imaging if necessary for confirmation or to investi\u00ad gate associated anomalies or differential diagnoses.[9] In our patient, the diagnosis was confirmed through the findings of ultrasonography, FNA cytology, and exploratory surgery. Polyorchidism necessitates no further management if the supernumerary testes are uncomplicated and located in the scrotum. Regular ultrasonographic check-ups are recom\u00ad mended, with orchidopexy required for cryptorchidism and orchiectomy for suspected malignancy.[10] Our patient was initiated on a tuberculosis treatment regimen for the testicu\u00ad lar tuberculosis and scheduled for further follow-up, as all testes appeared healthy. Conclusions Polyorchidism is a rare congenital anomaly, with ultrasonog\u00ad raphy being the primary diagnostic tool. Magnetic resonance imaging may complement the diagnosis if needed. Gener\u00ad ally, uncomplicated cases require no further treatment, but patients should undergo regular ultrasonographic follow- up. Any risk of malignancy necessitates the removal of ex\u00ad tra testes. For our patient, ultrasonographic and FNA biopsy investigations confirmed the diagnosis, and the patient was scheduled for follow-up. Given the rarity of bilateral poly\u00ad orchidism (only 10 cases reported in the literature), our pa\u00ad tient\u2019s presentation and complications contribute to the body of knowledge on the topic, and this report serves as a valu\u00ad able reference point for comparing bilateral polyorchidism with other possible presentations and manifestations.

Expression of hormone receptors and molecular-subtyping is paramount in rationalizing prognosis and therapy. There exists significant variation in molecular status of breast cancer in SSA. We aimed to describe the receptor status and molecular subtypes of breast cancer at our centre. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on patients with breast cancer enrolling for oncological care at our centre beginning May 2018 to December 2021. Results We included 345 patients with a median age of 49 years, 331 female and 14 males. The most common histological variant was invasive-ductal -carcinoma of no-special-type from both biopsy (84.3%) and mastectomy specimens (82.8%). DCIS accounted for only 2.9%. ER positive tumours accounted for 62.8% from biopsy and 66.7% from mastectomy specimens. The majority of the female patients had luminal-type disease (Luminal A or B) with 65.2% from biopsy specimens and 67.3% from mastectomy specimens. About 20% had TNBC. Conclusion Breast cancer patients from Nakuru, Kenya, are likely to be young and with luminal-subtype invasive ductal carcinoma. In contrast to some previous reports, less than a quarter of our patients have TNBC. We recommend prioritization, standardization and scaling of receptor testing and molecular-subtyping to optimize treatment protocols and personalized management strategies for breast cancer patients. Introduction Breast cancer is the leading cancer, both in incidence and mortality, among women worldwide.1 It is also the second commonest cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)2 Additionally, while the incidence of breast cancer is on the rise in SSA, the prognosis is poorer than in Western countries.3 In Kenya, the incidence of breast cancer among women is the highest compared to other cancers.2 Breast cancer is treated based on the clinical, pathological and im\u00ad munohistochemical characteristics of the tumours and the outcomes of breast cancer management depend on the clin\u00ad ical and pathological stages of the tumour, nodal status, and on the histological types.4 The presentation, diagnosis and initiation of treatment of breast cancer in SSA is likely to be late due to innate challenges in seeking, reaching, and accessing care.5 Breast cancer hormone receptor status is particularly useful for predicting the likely prognosis and tailoring treatment.6 Ad\u00ad ditionally, the receptor status is paramount in determining This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(2):35-41. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.7 the molecular pattern of the cancer and the need for targeted therapy.7 This can help reduce over or under undertreat\u00ad ment by enabling prediction of the likely response to treat\u00ad ment, the probability of recurrence and by helping appor\u00ad tion patient and risk-specific adjuvant therapy.8 However, the difficulties in the management of breast cancer in SSA is further hampered by the general unavailability of molec\u00ad ular testing.3This contributes to higher cancer related mor\u00ad tality rates than incidence in SSA.1,9 In contrast, in the Western world, there exists elaborate screening programs and diagnosis is as a result likely to be made earlier and treatment commenced earlier.8 Breast cancer subtypes can be identified and classified using immunohistochemistry (IHC), combining oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and Ki-67 index (a human nuclear antigen proliferative marker), into four intrinsic molecular subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-en\u00ad riched and basal-like (triple negative).7,10 More accurately, a micro-array-based gene expression profiling (GEP) could be used for this classification.10 GEP is however largely un\u00ad available in Kenya and IHC is commonly used as the best substitute. These recent improvements in the knowledge of breast cancer have highlighted the importance of molecu\u00ad lar subtypes in its understanding and management. For ex\u00ad ample, the luminal molecular subtypes (which stain posi\u00ad tive for oestrogen receptor) are commonly associated with better prognosis, globally.8,9,11 In addition, triple negative breast cancer has been found to be common in younger fe\u00ad male patients, to present with advanced disease and to have a higher risk of recurrence and a poorer outcome.4,9 Brin\u00ad ton and colleagues argue that majority of breast cancers in Africa are likely to be hormone receptor negative and triple negative subtypes.12 However, there exists a noteworthy variation in the molecular status of breast cancer in SSA.1 For example, Hawary et al showed predominance of lumi\u00ad nal A in a subset of Egyptian patients.11 Likewise, Sayed et al found that in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital, the majority of patients seeking care for breast cancer had hormone recep\u00ad tor positive disease.13 Generalization on the basis of geog\u00ad raphy is therefore unpredictable. There are no studies assessing the receptor status and/ or molecular subtypes of breast cancers from our region. We therefore conducted a descriptive study to determine the pattern of receptor and molecular status of breast cancer among patients receiving care at our centre. The centre is the region\u2019s principal referral hospital. Methods We carried out a descriptive retrospective study at the Nakuru Level 5 hospital\u2019s new oncology unit, in Kenya. The hospital serves a catchment of 2.3 million people. We included all patients of all ages with or without a prior histological diagnosis of breast cancer who were enrolled for care as walk-ins or as referrals between May 2018 and December 2021. We excluded patients whose full records could not be retrieved. Patient and disease particulars were retrieved from their records using a secure web-based questionnaire; this data was collected as routine data at the point of initiation of care. We collected data on patient demographics, tumour histological type and receptor status. Hormone receptor status was classified as positive where the pathology result read positive or where the Allred score was 2 to 8.14 Her-2/Neu status was interpreted as fol\u00ad lows; score of 0 as negative, 1+ as negative, 2+ as equiv\u00ad ocal and 3+ as positive according to the College of Amer\u00ad ican Pathologists (CAP) guidelines.15 The receptor status was used to assign a molecular subtype using the schema shown in table 1.16 Due to a foreseen challenge with un\u00ad availability of Ki-67 results from the majority of pathology reports, luminal A and B were not be specified and were in effect classified as a \u2018Luminal cancers\u2019 Table 1. This table illustrates a schematic guide on assignment of molecular subtypes of breast cancers from the receptor status and Ki-67 index.

Ethical approval for the study was given by the Nakuru Level V Hospital institutional review committee. (ERC/ NLV5/2021/9-04) Results Patient characteristics Four hundred and three patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer attended our centre during the study period. We ex\u00ad cluded 58 patients whose full records could not be retrieved leaving 345 patients in our study with a median age of 49 years, (interquartile range (iqr); 40, 61). The patients were predominantly female, with only 14 (4.0%) being male. The majority of the patients (n=192, 55.6%) were below 50 years of age. The characteristics of the included patients are summarized in table 2 below.

The most common histological vari\u00ad ant was invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC) from both the biopsy (84.3%, n=236 of 280) and mastec\u00ad tomy specimens (82.8%, n=125 of 151). DCIS accounted for only 2.9% (n=8) of biopsy specimens and 0.7% (n=1) of the histology from mastectomy specimens. The distribution of other histological variants is demonstrated in table 3 be\u00ad low. Receptor status IHC receptor status from biopsy specimens were unavail\u00ad able for 42.3% of patients, whereas, receptor status testing was available in 51.4% of the patients that underwent surgery. Only 29 patients had ER, PR, and HER2 status data available from both their biopsy and surgical speci\u00ad mens. In respect to the patients whose IHC results were available, ER positive tumours accounted for 62.8% (n=125 of 199) from biopsy and 66.7% (n=74 of 111) from mastec\u00ad tomy specimens. The results for Her2 receptors and Ki-67 index are demonstrated in table 3 above. (Distribution of the receptor status among gender and age groups is avail\u00ad able as a supplementary file). Molecular status The majority of the female patients had luminal type dis\u00ad ease (Luminal A or B) with 65.2% from biopsy specimens and 67.3% (n=76 of 113) from mastectomy specimens. As shown in table 4 below, majority of the patients with lumi\u00ad nal type disease were below 50 years of age. None of the male patients had triple negative disease but 22.0% (n=42 of 191) of female IHC from biopsy and 21.1% (n=23 of 109) from mastectomy were triple negative subtype. Discussion Our study demonstrated that breast cancer patients from our centre are likely to be young (below 50 years of age) and with luminal subtype invasive ductal carcinoma. Less than a quarter of our patients had triple negative disease. The characterization of receptor status and determination of the molecular subtype of breast cancer is paramount in the choice of therapy and determining prognosis.1 An impor\u00ad tant limitation of our study was the limited number of mas\u00ad tectomy specimens submitted for IHC staining even in the face of probable discrepancies between preoperative biopsy IHC and IHC from surgical specimens. This was likely due to low level of awareness on utility of receptor and molecu\u00ad lar typing after surgery and/or financial constraints. Several authors have previously argued that breast can\u00ad cer, specifically Luminal A cancer, is expected to be com\u00ad mon in postmenopausal women.17,18 For example, in Nige\u00ad ria, ER positive tumours were shown to be more prevalent in women older than 50 years.19 However, there are nu\u00ad merous conflicting reports from our region that cite that the majority of patients diagnosed with breast cancer are young and likely to be below 50 years of age. This has pre\u00ad viously been demonstrated by reports from Africa1,13,20 In our study, the median age was 49. In fact, the majority of the patients with ER positive disease were below 50 years of age. Sally et al argue that the observed prevalence in pre- menopausal age group is likely due to a generally low me\u00ad dian age in the African population.21 However, this finding may implicate reproductive risk factors and suggest a bio\u00ad logical basis of the early breast cancer in our population.20 Lastly, only 1.5% of our patients were above 80 years. This possibly suggests life expectancy and/or survival and might not be an actual reflection of breast cancer incidence in this age group from our region. The most commonly treated histological variant of breast cancer in our region is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of no special type.1,21,22 This corroborates with our findings and those of other authors from Kenya who re\u00ad ported rates of 84 to 90% from their series.13,23 Marianne et al reported that 87% of their patients from Tanzania had IDC which is comparable to 82.3% reported from Nige\u00ad ria by Adebamowo and colleagues.1,19 In addition, only 2.9% of our patients had DCIS. This is likely due to the ab\u00ad sence of a screening program in our region, but may also be a reflection of the health-seeking behaviour of the tar\u00ad get population. Similar findings have been reported from a 7 years retrospective review of an unscreened population from South Africa, citing a rate of 1.1% for DCIS; this is in contrast to settings with elaborate screening programs where cancers are likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage.18 Molecular Subtypes of Receptor-defined Breast Cancer from Nakuru, Kenya East and Central African Journal of Surgery 37 Table 3.

A recent systematic review on receptor-de\u00ad fined subtypes of breast cancer in indigenous populations in Africa established that the majority of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive, specifically ER positive.25 While some authors clearly dispute existence of a real dif\u00ad ference in hormone receptor status of Africans compared to other populations, Sayed et al argue that any perceived dif\u00ad ference is likely multifactorial.13,18,19 It is therefore postu\u00ad lated that adjusting for differences in age and other techni\u00ad cal factors in handling of IHC specimens could account for any perceived differences in hormone receptor status be\u00ad tween Africans and their matched cohorts from other geo\u00ad graphies.12 HER2 status is important in the choice of treatment, especially adjuvant chemotherapy, and in prognostication. Most breast cancers in Africa are however known not to ex\u00ad press HER2 receptors.12 Our study showed that only a third of our patients expressed HER2. Likewise, the Ki-67 in\u00ad dex is pivotal in prognostication and is also a component in the assignment of molecular subtype (as shown from table 1).7,16,26 In our study, majority of the patients did not have Ki-67 index results. While this could be due to challenges in tissue processing and inability to apply advanced IHC techniques, it was probably due to cost restraints (as its test\u00ad ing is costed separately) and/or low level of awareness on the utility of Ki-67 index among members of the healthcare team at our centre. This subsequently limited our ability to differentiate luminal A from luminal B disease. Several previous reports have argued that breast cancer in our region is predominantly triple negative subtype.18, 23 In contrast, we have found that the majority are in fact the luminal subtype (luminal A and B), with triple negative disease accounting for only 21.2% of diagnoses made from biopsy and 20.4% from mastectomy specimens. Our find\u00ad ings are in agreement with those of authors from Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa.1,13,24,27 Likewise, most tu\u00ad mours from a Nigerian series were of luminal subtype.19 As previously stated, it is likely that the molecular subtypes of breast cancer in Africa, e.g. triple negative breast cancer, is similar to that in other regions. However, since differ\u00ad ences could exist even within a population, genetic vari\u00ad abilities and/or selection biases could account for the previ\u00ad ous reports that found a higher prevalence of triple negative disease, in East Africa for example.13,17,23 Bird and col\u00ad leagues recommend genetic racial detailing to investigate for interracial heterogeneity in molecular subtypes of breast cancer.24 This is the first study describing molecular and receptor status of breast cancers in Nakuru. From our results, major\u00ad ity of cancers in our centre are likely to be invasive ductal carcinoma, expressing hormone receptor status and of lumi\u00ad nal molecular subtype. Importantly, we recognize the like\u00ad lihood of significant heterogeneity in receptor status and molecular subtypes that could exist even within our own population.18 We therefore agree with other authors that availability of receptor testing and molecular subtype deter\u00ad mination should be prioritized and that testing and interpre\u00ad tation of these results should be standardized.13,25 This will allow the conduct of better quality studies enabling age- matching, disease type (molecular subtype) matching and probably even treatment matched so as realize the delivery of biology-specific personalized care within our oncologi\u00ad cal care systems. Limitations Our study had several limitations. First, the study design was retrospective- therefore likely to suffer from several potential biases, confounders and missing data. Designing better and prospective future studies can possibly help avoid/reduce these sources of bias. Secondly, we were un\u00ad able to report on luminal A and luminal B disease subtypes separately due to the prominently missing data on Ki-67 in\u00ad dex. Sensitization of care givers on the importance and util\u00ad ity of Ki-67 in the treatment of breast cancer should be pri\u00ad oritized. Thirdly, our study was conducted from a single centre and the IHC testing was not standardized (in most instances were done from different labs). This possibly im\u00ad pacts on the reproducibility and generalizability of our find\u00ad ings. Nevertheless, we opine that our findings on molecular subtypes of breast cancers in our centre improves our cur\u00ad rent understanding of molecular subtypes of breast cancers in our region and will form the ground work for better de\u00ad signed studies. Conclusion Breast cancer patients from Nakuru, Kenya, are likely to be young and with luminal-subtype invasive ductal carcinoma. In contrast to some previous reports, less than a quarter of our patients have triple negative breast cancer. We recom\u00ad mend prioritization, standardization and scaling of receptor testing and molecular subtyping to optimize treatment pro\u00ad tocols and personalized management strategies for breast cancer patients.

National Surgical Obstetric and Anesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) emerged as crucial national policy frameworks to address this gap. Although some Sub-Saharan African countries have developed and launched NSOAPs, there is limited information on evaluation of the progress and effectiveness of these plans. This study aimed to assess progress and challenges in implementing Tanzania\u2019s NSOAP. Methodology We sent an electronic survey to all 26 Regional Health Management Teams (RHMTs) in mainland Tanzania to record their insights and understanding of the NSOAP and the state of Surgical Obstetric and Anesthesia (SOA). The RHMTs are key stakeholders in the NSOAP implementation as they oversee day-to-day implementation of all health interventions at the regional level. Results Only 4% of the surveyed RHMTs reported participating in the NSOAP development process, and 58% were unaware of the policy. The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist was rarely used, and surgical outreach programs were non-existent. There were gaps in the availability of SOA equipment and lack of radiological, intensive care and biomedical services. SOA specialists were few (1.96 specialists per 100,000 population). Most regions were excluded during the NSOAP dissemination meetings with no dedicated NSOAP coordinators at the regional level. Conclusion The NSOAP implementation faced various challenges in service delivery, infrastructure, equipment, human resources, information management and governance. Although slow progress has been made, there is a need for concerted efforts to achieve the NSOAP objectives. Future research should focus on comprehensive NSOAP evaluation and the establishment of an effective monitoring and evaluation framework. INTRODUCTION The 2015 report by Lancet Commission on Global Surgery highlighted significant disparities in access to safe and af\u00ad fordable surgical, obstetric, and anesthesia (SOA) services globally.1 Notably, it showed that over 90% of the popu\u00ad lation in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) lacked access to safe, timely, and affordable SOA services. To ad\u00ad dress this burden, countries were advised to prioritize SOA services through the development of National Surgical Ob\u00ad This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

Hellar AM, Akoko L, Jumbam DT, et al. An Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and Anesthesia Plan (NSOAP) in Tanzania. East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(2):15-22. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.4 stetric and Anesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) as part of their na\u00ad tional health plans.2 In recent years, there has been considerable progress in sub-Saharan Africa, with several countries, including Ethiopia, Zambia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Nigeria developing NSOAPs.2 These efforts aim to fulfil the 2015 World Health Assembly Resolution 68.153 to strengthen emergency and essential surgical care as part of Universal Health Coverage and the sustainable development goals. However, there has been limited evaluation of the imple\u00ad mentation status of these plans. We found one evaluation report for the 5-year implementation of the Ethiopia Surgi\u00ad cal plan4 but could not locate any mid-term or other evalu\u00ad ation reports for NSOAPs elsewhere. The United Republic of Tanzania was among the first countries to develop and launch a comprehensive NSOAP in 2018, with support from the GE Foundation, and the Safe Surgery 2020 consortium. The Tanzania NSOAP5 spans a timeframe of 2018-2025 and focuses on several objectives for improving access to SOA services through strengthen\u00ad ing the provision of care, training more SOA providers, enhancing referral pathways for emergency and essential surgical care, improving infrastructure and equipment, en\u00ad hancing data management systems, and advocating for re\u00ad sources to support surgical care.6 This study sought to assess the NSOAP implementation status aiming at understanding the achievements and chal\u00ad lenges specifically at the implementation level i.e. the re\u00ad gional level, with the aim of addressing the challenges. Al\u00ad though the survey tool was not constructed to specifically assess each NSOAP objective, it aimed at assessing the Re\u00ad gional Health Authorities understanding of the NSOAP and gather their views on the implementation of the plan and the general status of SOA services in their respective regions. To advocate for this plan, there is a need to understand the current extent of implementation, enabling and inhibit\u00ad ing factors, steps needed to realize the 2025 target and spe\u00ad cific recommendations for future improvement. METHODOLOGY Study area Tanzania has 26 Regional Health Management Teams (RHMTs) composed of the Regional Medical Officer (RMO), Regional Health Secretary, Regional Reproductive Child Health Coordinator, and other departmental man\u00ad agers within the region. The RHMT oversees health ac\u00ad tivities within their regions including SOA services. The NSOAP was designed to be implemented by RHMTs, hence the expectation that they understand its deliverables. Design We carried out a cross-sectional quantitative study using convenience sampling to collect insights through an elec\u00ad tronic survey sent to key stakeholders involved in the plan\u00ad ning and implementation of SOA services at regional and district levels. Each RHMT was asked to complete one sur\u00ad vey tool to describe the status of SOA services in the region from the survey questions. All regions in mainland Tanza\u00ad nia were included in the survey. Data Collection Methods We distributed an electronic survey to RHMTs in March 2022 (4 years post-NSOAP launch). The survey tool was organized around the NSOAP objectives: service delivery, referral systems, information management, support ser\u00ad vices, and the number of available SOA specialists. The survey consisted of closed-ended questions. The electronic link to the survey was sent to the Re\u00ad gional Medical Officer in each region, and the interviewer followed up with a phone call to ensure that questions were clear to the respondents and the survey was completed timely. We also involved the officials from the President\u2019s Office Regional Authority and Local Government Author\u00ad ity (PORALG) in this assessment since they oversee imple\u00ad mentation of health programs at the regional level and were instrumental in ensuring each region responded to this sur\u00ad vey. Data Analysis We conducted descriptive data analysis and summarized the findings as appropriate using Microsoft Excel. No sta\u00ad tistical tests were performed. The findings from the survey were categorized into key NSOAP domains i.e., service de\u00ad livery, infrastructure and equipment, human resources, in\u00ad formation management, finance, and governance. RESULTS We sent an electronic survey to all RHMTs in all 26 regions of Mainland Tanzania to gather information on provision of SOA services at the regional/district levels. Each re\u00ad gional team completed one questionnaire. All 26 regions re\u00ad sponded to the survey. The Regional Medical Officer is the responsible officer for the RHMT with mandate to guide decisions, but the team is composed of other members in\u00ad cluding Regional Health Secretary, Regional Reproductive Child Health Coordinator, Regional Dentist, Regional Phar\u00ad macist, Regional Laboratory Officer, and other heads of Departments at the regional level. The distribution of the respondents and their roles in the RHMT is summarized in Table 1. Knowledge of NSOAP policy When asked about their awareness of the NSOAP, 15 (58%) of the 26 RHMTs were not aware of its existence and only 1 (4%) of the interviewed RHMT acknowledged that they were involved during NSOAP planning in 2018.

Distribution of RHMT respondents and their roles Respondent Number of Regions Regional Medical Officer 17 Regional Reproductive and Child Health Coordinator 4 Regional Nursing Officer 1 Regional Emergency Coordinator 1 Regional Clinical Services Coordinator 1 Regional Health Management Information System Focal Person 1 Regional Health Secretary 1 Total Responses 26 65.3% of the Responses were given by the Regional Medical Officers (RMOs) Dedicated Ambulance service 16 out of the 26 RHMTs (62%) reported availability of ded\u00ad icated ambulance services in all or most of their district councils while 10 (35%) indicated that less than half of their district councils had these services. Surgical Safety Checklist Utilization When asked about the frequency of WHO Surgical Safety Checklist utilization in SOA facilities, only 2 out of the 26 RHMTs (8%) reported consistent use (i.e. routine use of the checklist for every surgical case in the operating room) in all or more than half of their facilities. 13 participants (50%) noted that less than half of their facilities ever used the checklist and 11 (42%) stated that none of their facili\u00ad ties used the checklist at all. Surgical Outreach Programs 24 (92%) out of the 26 RHMTs surveyed reported that less than half of their district councils had an established formal surgical outreach program. Only 2 (8%) of the RHMTs re\u00ad ported having an established outreach program in all district councils. Surgical equipment and supplies When asked about the proportion of SOA facilities equipped with the necessary equipment, only 9 (35%) of the 26 RHMTs stated that all or more than half of the SOA facilities in their regions possess all the necessary equip\u00ad ment to provide services. 24, (92%) of the respondents re\u00ad ported lack of a fully functional radiology department. All 26 RHMTs (100%) indicated that either less than half or none of the SOA facilities had a functional Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Only 3 (12%) of the RHMTs reported that all or more than half of their facilities have access to biomed\u00ad ical equipment engineering technicians\u2019 (BMET) services. SOA Service Providers working at the regional level The Tanzanian NSOAP aims to increase the specialist SOA density from 0.46 per 100,000 population in 2017 to 2.27 per 100,000 population by 2025. According to Data from the Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT),7 there were 1,199 SOA specialists in Tanzania, translating to 1.96 SOA providers per 100,000 population (Table 1). In this survey, we recorded 297 SOA specialists working at the regional level (Figure 1). Majority were Obstetricians (43%) and General Surgeons (21.3%). This number excludes SOA providers at national and tertiary referral hospitals. Seven out of the 26 regions reported presence of anesthesiologists working at the regional level. About a quarter (27%) of the respondents reported availability of SOA training pro\u00ad grams in their regions. Since there was no baseline assess\u00ad ment conducted prior to the NSOAP launch, it is difficult to interpret whether these numbers have improved, or not. We correlated this data with the number of SOA special\u00ad ists recorded in the Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT) database. The number from the survey captures the SOA specialists working at the regional level specifically in the public sector, while the MCT numbers include specialists at tertiary hospitals and in the private sector. The total num\u00ad ber of SOA specialists in the MCT database is referenced in Table 2. Governance Only 7 out of the 26 RHMTs interviewed (27%) reported inclusion of SOA activities in their Comprehensive Council Health Plans (CCHPs). Only 3 of the 26 RHMTs (12%) were involved in NSOAP dissemination meetings and also 3 of the RHMTs interviewed (12%) had appointed a dedi\u00ad cated NSOAP coordinator at the regional level. DISCUSSION The Tanzania MOH launched the NSOAP in 2018 aiming to systematically strengthen SOA care in Tanzania over An Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 17 Figure 1. Number of reported SOA specialists working in the 26 regions of Mainland Tanzania There were 297 SOA specialists working in the regions. Majority of them were Obstetricians (43.0%) followed by General Surgeons (21.3%) seven years. This study represents the first national assess\u00ad ment of this policy document. Regarding SOA service delivery, the survey highlighted gaps in service provision at the district level. Referral sys\u00ad tems were found to need strengthening and this was similar to findings in other LMICs emphasizing the need to strengthen this area.8 Reducing maternal mortality is a key priority of the Tanzanian NSOAP. Availability of CEmONC services was limited, with a low percentage of health centers offering a full range of services, including c-section and blood trans\u00ad fusion services. Previous studies in Tanzania and elsewhere showed similar gaps, demonstrating a need for more fo\u00ad cused efforts to improve SOA services.9 Although there was an overall increase in the number of health facilities, shortages in critical services such as anesthesia and critical care persisted as previously.9 According to MCT data7 there was an increase in the number of SOA specialists (Table 2) (1.96 per 100,000 pop\u00ad ulation) compared to 0.46 per 100,000 population when the NSOAP was launched,6 possibly due to new graduates from the ongoing scale-up of post-graduate programs in various medical schools, but the density remained low com\u00ad pared to the Lancet Commission standards (20 SOA Providers per 100,000 population.1 However, these results may not necessarily reflect the targets set during the NSOAP launch.5 Fewer of these specialists were working at the regional level (Figure 1). The low awareness level of the NSOAP among the re\u00ad spondents is concerning, highlighting the need for enhanced efforts in NSOAP dissemination to key stakeholders. With\u00ad out adequate awareness, it is challenging to align the NSOAP objectives with the regional plans. The limited par\u00ad ticipation of RHMT members in the NSOAP development process raises questions about the inclusivity of stakehold\u00ad ers in shaping the plan. Active involvement and collabora\u00ad tion among key decision-makers at the regional level are essential for the effective implementation and sustainabil\u00ad ity of services. The lack of a governance structure at the re\u00ad gional level, as exampled by the absence of NSOAP coor\u00ad dinators is a significant barrier to the implementation of this plan. The availability of dedicated ambulance services in most district councils is encouraging, but there is a need to ensure consistent access and optimal utilization of these services. This includes addressing challenges such as infrastructure, resources, and coordination between ambulance services and healthcare facilities, as reported in a similar setting in Malawi.8 The WHO surgical safety checklist is recommended by the WHO to improve surgical quality and outcomes. The low utilization of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist high\u00ad lights a critical patient safety concern. Efforts should be directed toward promoting the widespread implementation and consistent use of the checklist across SOA facilities. To improve access and equity in surgical care, it is essential to strengthen surgical outreach programs, address infrastruc\u00ad ture gaps, and ensure the availability of appropriate equip\u00ad ment and supplies in all facilities providing SOA services. These best practices have been implemented in some set\u00ad tings in Tanzania as evidenced by the Safe Surgery Pro\u00ad ject10\u201112 calling for country-wide scale-up of such inter\u00ad An Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 18 Table 2. SOA Provider Density from MCT Database7 in June 2022: Data from Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT) Surgeons 654 (54.5%) General Surgeons 326 Plastic Surgeons 6 Urology 18 Orthopaedics and Trauma 169 Neurosurgery 9 Cardiothoracic 2 ENT 100 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery 24 Obstetricians 460 (38.4%) Anesthesiologists 85 (7.1%) TOTAL 1,199 Based on a population projection of 61.2 million (National Bureau of Statistics), the SOA Provider Density is 1.96 SOA specialists per 100,000 population. ventions. The findings regarding the functional radiology departments, laboratories, and intensive care units in SOA facilities indicate areas of concern with a need of ensuring availability of these critical components in promoting qual\u00ad ity and safety of surgical procedures, as highlighted in one study in a similar low-resource setting.13 The low-density ratio of SOA providers and the limited presence of anesthesiologists at the regional level highlights the need for strengthening the workforce capacity. Increas\u00ad ing the number of SOA specialists and ensuring their dis\u00ad tribution across regions is essential in improving the deliv\u00ad ery of safe services. The low percentage of SOA training programs indicates the need for greater emphasis on train\u00ad ing and integration of SOA services at the regional level, as recommended in the NSOAP. The limited involvement of regions in NSOAP dissem\u00ad ination and lack of dedicated NSOAP coordinators within the Ministry of Health raised concerns about the coordina\u00ad tion and implementation of the plan at the regional level. Effective communication, coordination, and leadership are crucial for the successful execution of the NSOAP. It is im\u00ad portant to follow the NSOAP development framework and pay attention to the key barriers in the translation of policy to practice.14,15 Study Limitations Due to limited time and resources, we could not use more interactive approaches such as focused group discussions, direct observations, or field visits. In addition, published lit\u00ad erature might be subject to bias, may not cover the latest developments, and might not capture the full range of per\u00ad spectives. As with many large-scale policy projects, it is challenging to attribute improvements in SOA services ex\u00ad clusively to NSOAP implementation since the NSOAP monitoring and evaluation framework had not been estab\u00ad lished. Furthermore, patient and community perspectives on the status of SOA services were not included and we did not also assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in delaying the plan implementation. CONCLUSION Findings from this analysis revealed important insights into the current state of SOA services and the implementation of the NSOAP in Tanzania. The findings highlight areas of strength and areas that require targeted interventions for improvement. To achieve the goals outlined in the NSOAP and enhance the overall quality and accessibility of SOA services, concerted efforts are needed at both the national and regional levels. Collab\u00ad oration, capacity-building, infrastructure development, and continuous monitoring and evaluation are vital for the suc\u00ad cessful implementation of the NSOAP and the improve\u00ad ment of SOA services at the regional and district levels. Several areas requiring attention and improvement were identified, including gaps in capacity for service provision, workforce shortage, infrastructure and equipment, coordi\u00ad nation and governance, and capacity building. Despite some positive aspects, such as an increase in the number of general healthcare facilities and a modest increase in the density of SOA providers, there are several challenges highlighted that need to be addressed to enhance the deliv\u00ad ery of safe and effective SOA services in the country and to achieve NSOAP objectives. In general, there is a paucity of literature specific to NSOAP implementation in Tanzania, highlighting the need for more research and evaluation studies to generate addi\u00ad tional information. An Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 19 RECOMMENDATIONS Based on the discussion and findings, the following specific recommendations are proposed in ensuring that the NSOAP will be implemented effectively as intended: NSOAP Dissemination: There is a need to ensure that the NSOAP is disseminated to all key stakeholders espe\u00ad cially those working at the implementation level i.e., the re\u00ad gional and district levels. Monitoring and Evaluation of the NSOAP Imple\u00ad mentation: There is an urgent need to fast-track the im\u00ad plementation of the NSOAP monitoring and evaluation im\u00ad plementation framework. This will allow better collection of SOA related indicators to be able to track performance of the services in general such as types of surgeries, anes\u00ad thesia details, patient outcomes and other gaps in SOA ser\u00ad vice provision. These indicators will be useful in tracking progress of achievement of the NSOAP objectives. Strengthen capacity at the district level: Efforts should be made to strengthen the capacity of SOA service provision at the district level. This includes improving re\u00ad ferral systems, expanding the availability of CEmONC ser\u00ad vices, addressing shortages in critical areas like anesthesia and critical care, and ensuring a robust supply chain for SOA-specific supplies and consumables. Increase the number of skilled SOA professionals: To meet the growing demand for SOA services, there is a need to increase the number of skilled healthcare professionals, particularly anesthesiologists. Strategies should be imple\u00ad mented to improve the recruitment, training, and distribu\u00ad tion of healthcare professionals in the SOA field. Specific actions should be taken for critical areas such as anesthe\u00ad sia and critical care through sensitizing medical students to aspire for these specializations and provision of motivation packages and sponsorship opportunities for those who wish to specialize in these cadres. Enhance coordination and governance: The coordina\u00ad tion and implementation of the NSOAP should be strength\u00ad ened at both the national and regional levels. This includes increasing awareness of the plan among key stakeholders, fostering greater participation and engagement in the plan\u00ad ning process, improving communication and coordination among healthcare professionals and decision-makers, and appointing dedicated NSOAP coordinators at the regional level. Promote standardized training and guidelines: Ef\u00ad forts should be made to develop standardized training pro\u00ad grams for health providers in the SOA field, including es\u00ad tablishment of surgical outreach and mentorship programs to lower-level facilities. SOPs and clinical guidelines for SOA should be developed and coordinated at the national level to ensure consistent quality of care. Training pro\u00ad grams, mentorship and continuous monitoring should be encouraged to promote adherence to safety protocols, such as the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. Secure funding and evaluate progress: More aggres\u00ad sive efforts are needed to secure funding for the imple\u00ad mentation of the NSOAP. Regular evaluations should be conducted to assess the progress made, identify existing barriers, and revise the plan to reflect the current reality on the ground. There is a need to continue to advocate for NSOAP funding and identify donors who will be able to provide funding for the activities outlined in the NSOAP. Otherwise, most activities in the plan will never be imple\u00ad mented to the same extent as stipulated in the plan. Revitalize the NSOAP Technical Working Group: The NSOAP Technical Working Group at the national level plays a vital role in coordinating partners involved in SOA projects. Efforts should be made to revitalize the group and ensure its active participation in driving the implementation of the NSOAP. NSOAP Mid-term Evaluation: we recommend a more robust evaluation of NSOAP implementation through a mid-term evaluation exercise using more interactive meth\u00ad ods to assess ALL NSOAP strategic objectives and activ\u00ad ities outlined in the plan, and hence show a more realistic picture of the state of implementation to date. Key Lessons learnt Baseline Assessment: A critical aspect often overlooked in policy implementation is the necessity of conducting a comprehensive baseline assessment. This foundational step serves as a crucial benchmark, providing insights into the existing state and capacity within the healthcare system. In our case, a baseline assessment would have helped to estab\u00ad lish the status quo and provide a more meaningful under\u00ad standing of the availability of services, infrastructure, and human resources at the outset to be able to track progress over time. It is therefore critical to invest time and resources in thoroughly understanding the existing healthcare land\u00ad scape before embarking on an ambitious policy endeavour, such as the NSOAP. Policy Dissemination: It is essential to ensure that the policy is widely disseminated to all key stakeholders, espe\u00ad cially those that are involved in the day-to-day implemen\u00ad tation of activities related to the plan such as the RHMTs. In our case, the limited participation of RHMT members in the NSOAP development process and their general lack of awareness about the plan, might have contributed to the slow implementation of the plan at the ground level. Funding: The successful implementation and sustained impact of the NSOAP is heavily dependent on a robust and sustainable financing plan. Adequate funding is the lifeblood that ensures the realization of proposed interven\u00ad tions, the improvement of healthcare infrastructure, and the enhancement of SOA services. Creating a sustainable fi\u00ad nancing plan involves multi-stakeholder collaboration. The financing plan should be intricately linked to the policy ob\u00ad jectives outlined in the NSOAP. Advocacy efforts at both An Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 20 national and international levels are integral to securing sustained funding for the NSOAP. Governance Structure: Without effective leadership at the implementation level of the plan, success is unlikely to be achieved. The absence of NSOAP coordinators at the re\u00ad gional level is a significant barrier to plan implementation. Establishing a governance structure at the regional level and appointing dedicated coordinators will enhance the ef\u00ad fectiveness of the NSOAP. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework: Establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework for the NSOAP is essential. This would enable tracking progress, attributing improvements in SOA services to NSOAP implementation, and identifying areas that require adjustments.

It is a potentially fatal infection. The risk factors include pre-existing thyroid disorders, immunosuppression, and neck procedures. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. The case report aims to demonstrate the rarity of a huge thyroid abscess caused by Serratia odorifera in a postpartum woman. A 42-year-old female with no known comorbidity but a 2-year history of an un-investigated thyroid mass and 1 month postpartum presented with 3 weeks of a painful anterior neck mass. She had no clinical features of hyperthyroidism although the thyroid hormone levels were consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. The thyroid abscess was confirmed by ultrasound scan. It was managed with appropriate antibiotics, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, and surgical drainage with a good outcome. We present a rare case of thyroid abscess caused by Serratia odorifera in a postpartum woman with subclinical hyperthyroidism. For a huge thyroid abscess, we recommend incision and drainage, and a minimum of two weeks of appropriate antibiotics. Background Thyroid abscess is a rare condition, and acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) accounts for <1% of thyroid diseases.1 AST progresses to thyroid abscess and is a potentially fatal infection.2,3 The majority of AST occurs in the left thyroid lobe.3 The infection reaches the thyroid lobe via direct trauma, invasion from neighboring structures, and hematogenous spread.3 The risk factors include infective endocarditis, pre-existing thyroid disorders, immunosup\u00ad pression (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), and congenital abnormalities such as pyriform sinus fistula and persistent thyroglossal duct.1,4 Thyroid abscess has been reported af\u00ad ter fine needle aspiration, trauma to the anterior neck, upper respiratory tract infection, multinodular goiter, autoimmune thyroiditis, and thyroid cancer.2,4,5 The organisms causing thyroid infections are bacteria (most commonly Staphylo\u00ad coccus aureus), Streptococcus species, Mycobacterium tu\u00ad berculosis, parasites, viruses, and fungi.1,5\u20118 The patient presents with classic and non-classic fea\u00ad tures of thyroid abscess. Patients might present with fever, neck pain, swelling, pressure symptoms, and airway com\u00ad promise.1 Depending on the thyroid hormone level, the patient might present with clinical features of hyperthy\u00ad roidism, hypothyroidism, or euthyroidism.1 Mycobacterial thyroid abscesses have been linked with a hyperthyroid state while hypothyroid in fungal thyroid infection.9 The diagnosis of thyroid abscess is clinical and the in\u00ad vestigative modalities include laboratory examination, neck radiographs, ultrasound and/or computer tomography (CT) scans, and fine needle aspiration biopsy.10 The ultrasound scan is the imaging of choice for the diagnosis of thyroid disease.1,3 The ultrasound scan shows fluid accumulation, the affected thyroid lobe, whether the lesion is unilocular or multilocular, and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes.3 Due to its rarity, management is guided by case reports and series.1 However, the management of choice for thy\u00ad roid abscesses remains antibiotics and surgical drainage.5 The preferred antibiotics include amoxicillin-clavulanate, This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

Case presentation A 42 years old female with no known comorbidity but a history of 2 years of an uninvestigated thyroid mass and 1-month post normal vaginal delivery presented with 3 weeks of painful anterior neck mass, pain on swallowing, loss of appetite, and general body weakness. She had no fevers or chills, difficulty in breathing, cough, palpitations, anxiety, heat intolerance, or weight loss. She denied any neck surgical procedure before the presentation and neither took alcohol nor smoked. On physical examination, she was noted to be afebrile (36.7), normotensive (128/72 mmHg), and oxygen satura\u00ad tion of 97%. On admission, the pulse was 122 beats per minute and reduced to normal ranges throughout her admis\u00ad sion. She had no clinical signs of hyperthyroidism. She had a huge 12cm*14cm tender anterior neck swelling without palpable lymph nodes. The swelling was soft and fluctuant with shiny overlying skin. The oropharynx and the rest of the systemic examination were non-revealing. Laboratory tests revealed moderate microcytic anemia 7.70g/dl, leukocytosis (WCC 11.13x10^9/L), neutrophilia 80.6% with thrombocytosis of 836x10^9/L. Chemistry re\u00ad vealed sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 3.0 mmol/L, urea of 2.6 mmol/L, and creatinine of 68 \u00b5mol/L. The thy\u00ad roid function test revealed low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.04mIU/L with normal free thyroxine (T4) 15.18 pmol/L and free tri-iodothyronine (T3) 4.32 pmol/L. Ultrasound scan showed enlarged thyroid lobes with the right lobe having a central necrotic loculated lesion con\u00ad cerning an abscess and no cervical lymphadenopathy. The pus was negative for Mycobacterial PCR GeneXpert and so was the urine Mycobacterial Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen test. Pus studies revealed a gram-negative bacilli Serratia odorifera sensitive to amikacin, ceftriaxone, cephalothin, gentamicin, and ofloxacin. The chest radi\u00ad ograph and computer tomography (CT) scan were not done as they were not accessible at the time. The thyroid abscess was initially aspirated under ultra\u00ad sound guidance (100ml drained) and on day 3 the site of the puncture burst and a formal incision and drainage were performed under local anesthesia. About 80 ml of thick yel\u00ad lowish non-foul-smelling pus was drained (figure 1). The pus progressively reduced in volume without reaccumulat\u00ad ing. She was empirically placed on intravenous cloxacillin Figure 1. Post open surgical drainage of the thyroid abscess 500mg four times a day for five days before being switched to intravenous ceftriaxone 1g twice daily based on the lab\u00ad oratory antibiogram. For pain, she received paracetamol 1g thrice daily orally. She was discharged on day 6 on oral ofloxacin 400mg twice daily for a week and Pregamal (Fer\u00ad rous Fumarate and Folic Acid) one tablet per day for thirty days. The follow-up was uneventful. Discussion The final diagnosis was a thyroid abscess in a postpartum woman. Thyroid abscess is rare due to its fibrous encap\u00ad sulation, iodine-rich environment, extensive lymphatic drainage, and abundant dual blood supply.1,2 Infection of the neck risks airway compromise and therefore requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.2 A thyroid abscess is a se\u00ad rious, life-threatening endocrine emergency.2 Thyroid abscess is frequently reported in children and females aged 20 to 40 years.5,10 Thyroid abscesses are commonly observed on the left side although it involved more of the right thyroid lobe in our 42-year-old postpartum mother.8,11\u201113 Meanwhile, some studies show that ab\u00ad scesses occur equally in each thyroid lobe.2 A pre-existing thyroid disorder is a risk factor for thyroid abscess forma\u00ad tion and our patient had a longstanding thyroid swelling which was not investigated before admission for thyroid ab\u00ad scess.1,4,8 Clinically, our patient did not present with clas\u00ad sic features of hyperthyroidism such as heat intolerance, palpitations, tremors, anxiety, weight loss, and increased appetite.2 Although all her vitals were normal throughout the hospital stay, she was tachycardic on admission. The tachycardia could have been attributed to pain or infection which resolved after treatment.14 In our case, the thyroid hormone levels were consistent with subclinical hyperthy\u00ad roidism. Euthyroid, as well as hypothyroidism, has been reported in thyroid abscesses.1,11 Other authors argue that rarely is hyperthyroidism associated with acute suppurative Thyroid abscess in a postpartum woman with subclinical hyperthyroidism: A Case Report East and Central African Journal of Surgery 6 thyroiditis7 as the majority of patients (83.1%) with bac\u00ad terial infections of the thyroid were euthyroid.9 However, hyperthyroidism has been documented in thyroid abscesses in the background of a multinodular goiter.15 Furthermore, transient thyrotoxicosis in thyroid abscesses has been attrib\u00ad uted to the release of thyroid hormones by the damaged thy\u00ad roid follicles.12 The classic features of thyroid abscess are fever, cervical pain, and a painful mass,13 and the majority of patients pre\u00ad sent with painful neck swelling.1,4,5 Patients could present with difficulties in breathing, dysphonia, and odynopha\u00ad gia.2,9 In our case, she presented with both classic and non- classic features of thyroid abscess. Some authors lament that non-classic presentation led to a low index of clinical suspicion.10 Furthermore, misinterpretation of the available imaging modalities results in delayed diagnosis of thyroid abscess and progressive respiratory insult.10 Thyroid abscess was confirmed through clinical findings and ultrasound scan.13 The ultrasound scan speedily identi\u00ad fied the abscess, affected thyroid lobe, and size, and guided the percutaneous aspiration.10 The ultrasound was cost- effective, highly accessible, and confirmed the diagnosis without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation.10 The CT scan was not readily accessible or reported at our facil\u00ad ity. Arguably, the CT scan is the next modality of choice provided the ultrasound scan is inconclusive.1 Although the CT scan of the neck was never performed in our case, it de\u00ad lineate the thyroid abscess, the extent of the infection, dis\u00ad placed structures, and extra-thyroidal extension.7,15 The traditional management of choice for an abscess is surgical drainage and antibiotics. Moreover, modalities such as ultrasound or CT-guided drainage or needle as\u00ad piration, transcervical incision and drainage, and transoral drainage are utilized.1,5 Literature showed that needle aspi\u00ad ration drainage is recommended for thyroid abscesses less than three centimeters while catheter drainage for greater than three centimeters.5 In unstable cases with airway com\u00ad promise, it is recommended to urgently drain the abscess.2 In our case, transcervical incision and drainage were per\u00ad formed after an unsuccessful ultrasound-guided needle as\u00ad piration. Our case serves as an example of a failure or inad\u00ad equacy of ultrasound-guided needle aspiration in managing a huge thyroid abscess. Therefore, we recommend incision and drainage for a huge thyroid abscess. Additionally, thyroidectomy is reserved for failed open drainage, and persistent or recurrent abscesses.2,12 To re\u00ad move the local source of infection, thyroid lobectomy has been performed in patients with no clinical improvement after non-operative treatment.2,3,15 Other surgical options employed to relieve pressure symptoms caused by the thy\u00ad roid abscess include total thyroidectomy, near-total thy\u00ad roidectomy, and hemithyroidectomy.3 In our case, the pus analysis showed a gram-negative bacillus S. odorifera. As such, this case study adds S. odor\u00ad ifera to the list of possible causes of a huge thyroid abscess. Multiple causative pathogens have been documented, mostly S. aureus and Streptococcus species, but also Es\u00ad cherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Hemophilus influenza, Eikenella corrodens, M. tubercu\u00ad losis, parasite, viruses, candida.1,2,5\u20117 Thyroid abscesses caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter cal\u00ad coaceticus and baumanii have been reported.1,5,7,9 How\u00ad ever, in some cases of thyroid abscesses, the causative or\u00ad ganisms are not established.1,7 Several routes have been used to administer antibiotics in thyroid abscesses, mainly orally and intravenously, but also injected in the abscess cavity after aspirating the pus.5 In our case, intravenous cloxacillin was administered em\u00ad pirically and switched to intravenous ceftriaxone based on sensitivity pattern with a good outcome. Ceftriaxone has also been used in K. pneumoniae thyroid abscesses with a good outcome.11 Other antibiotics documented in treating thyroid abscesses are amoxicillin-clavulanate, benzylpeni\u00ad cillin, clindamycin, azithromycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin.2,5,7 An average of 14 days of antibiotic therapy was found to be sufficient in treating thyroid abscesses.2,12 Furthermore, it is recom\u00ad mended to use antimicrobial therapy for a minimum of two weeks in treating thyroid abscess, and the choice of antibi\u00ad otic is based on laboratory antibiogram.3 In case of delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and/or untreated condition, the disease causes significant morbid\u00ad ity and mortality.3,10 The mortality rate ranges from 3.7 to 12.1%.2,4,9 Besides being a life-threatening endocrine emergency, it can complicate into failed drainage, abscess rupture, persistent abscesses, fistulae to the trachea or esophagus, descending necrotizing mediastinitis, sepsis, airway compromise, and recurrent acute suppurative thy\u00ad roiditis.1,2,5,12 Conclusion Thyroid abscess is an extremely rare condition. We present a rare case of thyroid abscess in a postpartum woman with subclinical hyperthyroidism and add Serratia odorifera to the list of possible causes of thyroid abscess. The ultra\u00ad sound scan remains the preferred imaging of choice in the diagnosis and needle-guided treatment of thyroid abscess. For a huge thyroid abscess, we recommend incision and drainage, and a minimum of two weeks of appropriate an\u00ad tibiotic therapy. The outcome is good with appropriate management.

Worldwide revision rates vary between 4.9-7.9%. However, in the sub-Saharan African region, revision total knee arthroplasty has rarely been studied. Broad Objective To determine the rate and indications for RTKAs in primary TKA surgeries operated at MOI between 2007 and 2018. Methodology This was a retrospective study. Revision TKA surgery data was collected from the TKA registry. Univariate analysis and descriptive statistics were used for analysis and presentation of categorical and continuous data. Statistical significance was determined in all relevant associations. Results Out a total of 607 primary TKA procedures recorded, 40 required revision, with a mean age of 69.1 years, a female predominance (60%) and a left knee predominance (62.5%), giving a revision rate of 6.59%. The causes of revision TKA included aseptic loosening (47.5%) and periprosthetic infections (32.5%). Both femoral and tibial components were revised in 50% of the surgeries. The mean duration from primary surgery until revision surgery was 4.1 years. Prosthesis infection was associated with early revision surgery (p value 0.008) but most patients had late revision TKA surgery (p value 0.02). Conclusion The rate of revision TKA at MOI was similar to worldwide rates. Most revisions were done late (after 2 years), and the predominant cause of revision was aseptic loosening, but infection was positively associated with early revision. BACKGROUND Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is the golden standard of care for treatment of advanced degenerative and rheuma\u00ad tologic knee diseases and specific knee fractures. Arthro\u00ad plasty is the most successful and effective surgical option to reduce pain and restore function in patients with severe osteoarthritis.1,2 TKA is done commonly worldwide3\u20115 and is the most common major orthopaedic procedure in the USA.6 TKA was first performed in the 1970s and it has been beneficial to a majority of recipients as it is cost-effective and improves the quality of life of the patients.7 Despite the effectiveness of TKA, a significant number of patients face the prospect of revision surgery due to the limited lifespan of the prosthesis and various other causes This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(2):29-34. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.6 including prosthesis loosening, persistent pain, instability and infection.8 There has also been a steady rise in the need for Revision TKA (RTKA) due to increasing life ex\u00ad pectancy and expanding indications of primary TKA.9\u201112 The cumulative survival rate of TKR was shown to be higher than 90% in the first 8 years, decreasing to 83.5% at 10 years, then maintaining stable results after 10 years.13 By the year 2030, TKA revisions in the United States will grow by approximately 600%, compared to 2005, to an es\u00ad timated 268,200 cases per year, with greater than 50% of these revision procedures expected to occur in the younger age groups starting from 2011.6,8,14 Studies have categorized the failure causes after total knee arthroplasties into early (within the first 2 years after primary TKA) and late revision. Due to bone loss and soft tissue insufficiency, the overall outcome of revision TKA is not as good as the primary arthroplasty.15\u201117 The revision often needs stemmed components and additional augments, in order to address deficient bone stock and soft tissue in\u00ad tegrity.6 Although aseptic loosening may be the leading cause of revision surgery, advancements in implants and surgical techniques has reduced this complication, and septic com\u00ad plications have instead relatively increased over time.7,18\u201120 There are many indications for TKA in the sub-Saharan Africa, but unfortunately most countries don\u2019t have ade\u00ad quate means to offer the service, including the necessary facilities, resources, and healthcare professionals. Although revision TKA is being done in Tanzania, not much is known about its epidemiology to make any significant com\u00ad parative analysis to other countries. The main aim of the study was to explore the rate and indications of revision knee arthroplasties in primary knee arthroplasty surgeries done at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute, located in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODOLOGY Study design and setting This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at Muhimbili Orthopaedic institute (MOI), the largest or\u00ad thopaedic and trauma referral institute in Tanzania, located in Dar es Salaam, with a 362-bed capacity, attending an av\u00ad erage of 4000 patients per week. Study population, duration, inclusion and exclusion criteria The study population included all patients 18 years and above, who underwent primary bicompartmental total knee arthroplasty (posterior stabilised design, cemented fixation) at MOI from 2007 to 2018 and subsequently had revision surgery at MOI. Patients who had their primary or revision TKAs done at other centres, were excluded due to either in\u00ad sufficient data, challenges in contacting and tracing patients and to reduce extraneous variable effect related to differ\u00ad ences in centre related treatment protocols and follow up. Data collection and management Data was collected, using a structured questionnaire, mainly from MOI\u2019s arthroplasty registry books. Data avail\u00ad able in the registry included patients\u2019 demographic charac\u00ad teristics (name, age and sex), indications for revision TKA surgery (diagnosis), types of surgery done and the surgery team members involved. Time lapse from primary to revi\u00ad sion TKA was calculated in years. Patients with prosthesis infection were confirmed by pre-operative elevated serum infectious markers (C-Reac\u00ad tive Protein and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and with/ without positive organism isolation and culture. Collected data was stored on a MS Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) database and exported to IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) software for analysis. Statistical analysis Univariate analysis was used for categorical variables. Mean, median, interquartile range and standard deviation were used for continuous variables. Chi-square test, Fisher T exact test and relative risk were used to determine associ\u00ad ation significance between variables. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated to quan\u00ad tify the precision of estimates in the population. A 5% alpha (p-value) was used to determine statistical significance dur\u00ad ing analysis and interpretation. Ethical Consideration Ethical clearance was obtained from MOI Ethics Board. Confidentiality of the data was observed throughout the study. The database access was limited only to the investi\u00ad gators. RESULTS 1. Socio-Demographic Characteristics of the Patients Table 1 summarises the patients\u2019 characteristics stratified by sex. A total of 607 primary TKAs (bicompartmental, posterior stabilised design, cemented fixation) were done between 2007 and 2018, and 40 cases were revised, giving a revision rate of 6.59% (95 % CI 4.75-8.87%). Female predominance (60%) was seen in revision TKA surgery (24 patients). The age range was 41 years, with a minimum age of 46 years. The mean and median ages were 69.1 years and 71.5 years respectively, with some differ\u00ad ences noted between the two genders (mean age difference p-value 0.91, median age difference p-value 0.97).

Indications of Revision TKA Surgery and Time Lapse from Primary TKA Surgery to Revision TKA surgery Majority of the revisions (25 patients or 62.5%) were done on the left knee (95% CI 45.8%-84.0%), compared to the right knee (p-value 0.08). Time period from primary TKA to revision TKA varied from 2 months to 12 years, with a mean period of 4.1 years (SD 2.9 years). More patients had late revisions (i.e. 2 years and above from primary TKA surgery) compared to early revisions; 28 patients (70%) with late revisions (95% CI 53-87%) vs. 12 patients (30%) with early revisions, (95% CI 4.1-55.9%) p-value 0.02. 3. Causes of Revision TKA surgery in the patients The predominant cause of revision TKA was aseptic loos\u00ad ening of the prosthesis (19 patients, 47.5%), followed by in\u00ad fection (13 patients 32.5%) and prosthetic instability (7 pa\u00ad tients, 17.5%) due to unbalanced ligaments, malposition of components and/or improper alignment. Prosthesis infec\u00ad tion was revised at an average of 1.3 years (SD 1.2) from the primary TKA and was positively associated with early revision surgery (RR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.3, p value 0.008). Aseptic loosening was revised at an average of 4.7 years (SD 2.5) from the primary TKA and was positively associ\u00ad ated with late revision surgery (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5, p value 0.018). 4. Types of Revision TKA surgeries in the patients From the 40 revisions done, 20 (50%) of them involved only revising both tibia and femoral knee components in the same sitting, while 13 revisions (32.5%) involved a combi\u00ad nation of staged surgical debridement, joint washouts, pros\u00ad thesis removal, use of antibiotics spacers and future pros\u00ad thesis fixation once infection was deemed clear (normal serum ESR and CRP for 3 months). Isolated same sitting Revision Knee Arthroplasties Done at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute, Tanzania, between 2007 and 2018 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 31 tibia component revision (5 patients, 12.5%) or femoral component revision (2 patients, 5%) was also observed. Male patients had a higher risk of early revision (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.6-3.8, p value 0.49) and a higher risk of infec\u00ad tion (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5-3.1, p value 0.58) while female patients had a higher risk of late revision (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.9, p value 0.31) and aseptic loosening (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.6-2.8, p value 0.40). DISCUSSION There are worldwide variations in TKA revision rates, due to disparities in access to quality healthcare resources and personnel. The study focussed on patients who had both their primary and revision knee arthroplasty surgeries done at MOI. These patients were managed at the same institute and hence exposed to similar treatment protocols, reducing extraneous variables. The incidence rate of 6.59% in this study was similar to Pabinger et al\u2019s systemic review which reported an overall 10 year worldwide revision rate of 6.2% ranging from 4.9% to 7.8%.21 While MOI\u2019s revision rate is within acceptable limits, others have reported both lower rates of up to 2.2%22 and even higher rates of 33.2%(34). Majority of the patients were females with a mean age of 69.1 years, similar to other previous studies.18,23 This dif\u00ad ference in gender representation was not statistically signif\u00ad icant. It is documented worldwide that most TKA revisions are due to aseptic loosening, infection and polyethene wear.3, 18,24,25 The causes of revision in this study were similar to multiple other previous studies. Aseptic loosening was the predominant cause of TKA revision in a study that analysed data from 844 patients between 2010 and 2011 attended from 6 hospitals in the USA.26 Lombardi et al. reported nearly 31.2% of patients who needed TKA revisions were due to aseptic loosening, while Peter et al., reported 39.9% of all TKA revisions were due to aseptic loosening.3 Delanois et al analysed TKA revision between 2009 and 2013 from the USA, and reported infection as the aetiology of TKA revision among 20.4% of patient,27 while Anne et al, found infection as the cause of revision among 36.1% of all revisions7 and Peter et al found infection among 27.4% as a cause for revision.3 Owing to differences in patient backgrounds and lifestyles, the causes of TKA failures in sub-Saharan Africa especially Tanzania may differ com\u00ad pared to other parts of the world. Majority of the revisions (62.5%) were done on the left knee, but no statistical significance was found between the left and right knee (p value 0.08). The mean time period from primary TKA to revision TKA was 4.1 years (SD 2.9) and study did significantly show 70% of the patients had late revisions (i.e., 2 years and above) compared to early revision surgery (p value 0.02). The findings are similar to other studies previously done. Postler et al reported a pri\u00ad mary TKA to revision surgery mean time of 6.2 years in 289 TKA surgeries performed,18 while another study done in the USA highlighted a time lapse from primary TKA to revision TKA was 5.9 years and that 35.3% of all revi\u00ad sions occurred early (28). Another study reported from the USA had comparable proportions of time until TKA revi\u00ad sions where early revisions comprised of 37.6% and late re\u00ad visions 62.4% among 781 revisions done in 10 years.3 An infected prosthesis was 4.2 times more likely to un\u00ad dergo early revision (p value 0.008) while a loose implant was 1.6 times more likely to undergo late revision (p value 0.018). Joint infection is likely to become evident much ear\u00ad lier than aseptic loosening, hence more likely to undergo re\u00ad vision surgery. No statistically significant associations were found between the two genders, causes of revision and early vs. late revision surgery. CONCLUSION The rate of revision TKA at MOI (6.59%) was similar to worldwide rates, with a mean age of 69.1 years, and a fe\u00ad male predominance of 60%. Most revisions (70%) were done late (after 2 years), and the predominant cause of re\u00ad vision was aseptic loosening (47.5%) which was positively associated with late revision while prosthetic infection was likely to lead to early revision TKA. Both femoral and tibia components were revised in 50% of the revision TKA surg\u00ad eries. A national arthroplasty surgery protocol and patient registry is recommended for future research on arthroplasty in Tanzania. STUDY LIMITATIONS The study focussed only patients who had both their pri\u00ad mary and revision knee arthroplasty surgeries done at MOI. Data was mainly collected from the arthroplasty registry, as it was difficult to contact and trace individual patients (not available via telephone) hence the results may not be com\u00ad pletely representative of the actual picture of revision TKA surgeries at MOI.

Trauma, infections, and non-communicable diseases are among indications of amputations, but changing trends have been highlighted in various regions. We aimed to describe the experience of limb amputations at our hospital to highlight patient characteristics, risk factors for mortality, and functional outcomes. Methods The study was a descriptive, retrospective case series of all patients who underwent limb amputation from January 1st 2018 to December 31st 2019. Patient data, including demographics, details of presentation, laboratory values, comorbidities, operations, and outcomes, were extracted from the electronic medical record. The primary outcomes were postoperative function and mortality. Comparison by risk factors for mortality was performed. Results 154 patients underwent amputation. 121 (78.5%) were lower limb amputations. The average age was 52.2 years. Average duration of illness was 120 days. 93 (60.4%) patients were men. 82 (53.9%) had at least one comorbidity. Trauma was an indication for 57 (37%) patients and 74 (48%) had arterial disease. Diabetes was the most common comorbidity (N=62; 40%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 10.4% (N=16). Patients with a presenting diagnosis of diabetes had increased mortality when compared to those without diabetes (19.2% vs. 5.9%; p=0.01). For the functional outcome, 59 (47.2%) were ambulant on crutches and 27 (21.6%) were using a wheelchair. Conclusions Trauma and vascular disease frequently contributes to the need for amputation in our region. Diabetes was present in one third of the patients, and was a significant risk factor for mortality. Recognition of the impact of medical comorbidities is warranted given these findings. Introduction An amputation is the surgical removal of a part of a body, such as an arm or a leg, and has been performed for cen\u00ad turies.1 Indications for amputation can include trauma, ma\u00ad lignancy, severe infections, and complications from various chronic diseases, including diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.2,3 In countries with lower development indices, the burden of trauma is devastating and increasing.4 In the past, most amputations were carried out because of trauma.5 There has been a shift towards lifestyle-caused diseases and other chronic illnesses that put patients at risk of amputation.6\u20119 There is a need to understand better the impact of trauma and non-communicable diseases on the need for amputation in our setting, to examine the risk factors for mortality, and This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(2):23-28. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.5 to assess the functional outcomes of patients after an ampu\u00ad tation. At Tenwek Hospital, limb amputation is a common pro\u00ad cedure performed by both the general surgery and or\u00ad thopaedic surgery services with various indications. We aimed to describe the experience with extremity amputation at our institution to highlight various patient characteristics such as the prevalence of trauma and non-communicable diseases, the risk factors for inpatient mortality, and their functional outcomes. Study area Tenwek Hospital, a faith-based tertiary referral centre in Bomet County, Kenya, provides emergency management, including potential emergency amputations, upon patient admission. Post-amputation, patients are placed in the crit\u00ad ical care unit, general surgical ward, or orthopaedic ward based on their cardiopulmonary status. During their stay, they receive standard treatments such as antibiotics, anal\u00ad gesics, and anticoagulation. They also undergo education on wound care, comorbidity management, and lifestyle ad\u00ad justments. A multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, physicians, physiotherapists, nutritionists, and nurses, guides rehabilitation. Two weeks post-surgery, patients re\u00ad turn for a wound assessment and potential prosthesis suit\u00ad ability evaluation by the physiotherapy team. Methods We performed a descriptive retrospective case series of pa\u00ad tients who underwent a partial or complete limb amputa\u00ad tion between January 1st, 2018 and December 31st, 2019. All patients who had a limb amputation were included. We extracted data through a chart review of patients identified to have undergone an amputation in the electronic medical record. We stored data in Microsoft Excel and performed the analysis in Stata (Version 16). During chart review of the electronic medical record, the following parameters were collected: age, sex, duration of presenting complaint, presence and duration of known rele\u00ad vant comorbidities, tobacco smoking status, initial random blood sugars, initial white blood cell count initial Erythro\u00ad cyte Sedimentation Rate, Human Immunodeficiency Virus status, Hemoglobin A1c level, any diagnosis of comorbid\u00ad ity while admitted, an attempt at limb salvage, amputation indication, after stump formalization, mortality, discharge diagnosis, and the patient\u2019s progress in terms of functional status. The primary outcomes were postoperative function and mortality. Risk factors for mortality were assessed, and descriptive statistics were utilized. Comparisons were per\u00ad formed on potential risk factors for the outcome of mor\u00ad tality by chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a Student\u2019s t-test for continuous variables.

Among these, 121 (78.5%) in\u00ad volved the lower limbs. The average age was 52.2 years (SD 21.7) and men constituted 93 (60.4%) patients. 82 pa\u00ad tients (53.9%) had at least one medical comorbidity, with 22 patients (14.3%) receiving a new diagnosis during ad\u00ad mission. Diabetes was the most common comorbidity (N=62, 40.3%). Arterial disease was the most common in\u00ad dication for amputation (N=74, 48.1%). Among patients with diabetes who had an HbA1c checked, the average was 10.3% (SD 3.3). Infection was listed as present in 100 pa\u00ad tients (64.9%). Patient characteristics are listed in table 1. The most common final amputation level was a below- knee amputation (BKA) (N=65, 42.2%). Sixty-six patients (42.9%) required a guillotine amputation. On functional outcomes, the majority were ambulant on crutches (N=59, 47.2%) and 27 (21.6%) patients used a wheelchair. The in- hospital mortality rate was 10.4% (N=16). Table 1 shows the attributes of the patients collected during their hospital visits.

Discussion Our findings demonstrate a considerable burden of disease due to amputations for both trauma and non-communicable disease in our population. There were a large number of guillotine amputations required (66 patients; 43%), which is a marker for the severity of the illness.9 Typically, these amputations are necessary when a limb is infected, and the patient is too sick to tolerate formalization during the initial operation. The rate of mortality for our series was consis\u00ad tent with other reports in Africa.3,8\u201111 From the region, half of the patients may experience complications after amputa\u00ad tion as reported in a case series from Tanzania.10 As often the last option available for patients, these findings indicate the severity and complexity of amputations at our hospital. There is an emerging shift from communicable to non- communicable diseases in developing countries.6 This study recorded the number of amputations caused by arter\u00ad ial disease at 48%, which aligns with similar estimates that point to a growing percentage of non-communicable dis\u00ad eases in the region.8 Forester et al. found that at a referral health facility in Cameroon, the most common reason pa\u00ad tients had amputations were infections and vascular disease from poorly treated diabetes and peripheral vascular dis\u00ad ease.12 Diabetes was present in one-third of patients, and a significant risk factor for mortality. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated the high incidence of di\u00ad abetes-related amputations to demonstrate the large burden of diabetes.13,14 At another facility in Kenya, Ogeng\u2019o et al. found that diabetic vascular disease was the most com\u00ad mon reason for amputation between October 1998 and De\u00ad cember 2008.15 This appears to be a growing problem with high inpatient mortality.10 Interestingly, the study from Ogeng\u2019o was before the widespread subsidization and increase of motorcycles.16 Thus, motor vehicle collisions have likely increased and trauma as an indication for amputation may increase as well. Trauma is increasing in Africa and in Kenya.16 A his\u00ad tory of trauma was responsible for 37% of amputations in our population. Efforts to prevent trauma are necessary.17 Several patients were diagnosed with a new medical co\u00ad morbidity during their admission for amputation. Diabetes was the most common newly diagnosed comorbidity (40%) and the prevalence of this is a potential future study topic. Practitioners should be aware of the higher risk of mortality among patients with diabetes who undergo amputation. The population\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding health seeking behavior can also be deduced from patients noted to have a new comorbidity diagnosis at admission.18 Delays on presentation to the hospital were considerable with an average of 120 days for the duration of illness. In\u00ad vestigation into referral patterns and health-seeking behav\u00ad ior appears necessary. Efforts to detect problems and avoid amputations, which have been effective in other settings, seem appropriate in our population.7 Altered function is assessed from a patient\u2019s rehabilita\u00ad tion using a prosthesis, crutches, or a wheelchair. The eco\u00ad nomic status of the study population is informative in this regard, as funds are an important factor that influences a pa\u00ad tient\u2019s decision on postoperative rehabilitation.10,19 Almost all patients did not have access to a prosthetic after ampu\u00ad tation. This limited uptake is an avenue for future interven\u00ad tion. There were several limitations to this study. The retro\u00ad spective nature of the chart review limited the outcomes available. The ability to determine the underlying cause of amputation and the impact of diabetes on arterial disease or infection was challenging.

Conclusion This paper looked to describe the most common indications for amputations in the population. Trauma and non-commu\u00ad nicable disease were found to be substantial causes of mor\u00ad bidity in the population studied. Medical comorbidities, like diabetes, have a significant impact on patient outcomes.

We aimed to describe the indications, management, and outcomes of patients managed with TT at AIC Litein Hospital in Southwestern Kenya. Methods This prospective study was undertaken between November 2020 and August 2022. All consecutive patients with TT were included. Data were collected on demographics, presentation, indications for TT, management, and outcome. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics and Research Committee. Results The study included 39 (33 male, 6 female) patients who had a mean age of 35 years (range 3-75) and 45 TTs placed for a median duration of 6 days (1-26). Hemopneumothorax (n=19), empyema thoracis (n=8), and pneumothorax (n=7) were the most common indications for TT. Trauma was noted in 28 cases presenting as assault (n=17), road traffic collision (n=8), fall (n=1), and barotrauma (n=1). Preadmission traumatic injuries led to four deaths, while fourteen (35.9%) patients developed TT-related complications, with three requiring TT replacement. Conclusions In this series, TT was mainly indicated for hemopneumothorax, empyema thoracis, and pneumothorax. Introduction Tube thoracostomy (TT) involves the placement of a drainage tube within the pleural cavity to remove accumu\u00ad lated air, fluid, blood, or pus.1\u20113 They are commonly in\u00ad serted in the \u201cTriangle of Safety\u201d at the fourth or fifth inter\u00ad costal space in the anterior or mid-axillary line.1,3,4 While the indications for TT might be similar for various health facilities, the distribution pattern of these indications may differ depending on the facility\u2019s size and catchment area, local trauma patterns, and management protocols.2,5 There is a paucity of published literature from Africa re\u00ad garding the use of TT, especially in smaller health facili\u00ad ties.2,5\u20118 The purpose of this study was to fill this identified gap in knowledge by reviewing our institution\u2019s experience with TT. Specifically, this prospective observational study aimed to describe the distribution of indications and pattern of complications of patients managed with TT at a single 220-bed capacity faith-based institution in Kericho County, Southwestern Kenya.

Indications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospective Case Series. East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(2):9-14. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.3 Methods This prospective case series was undertaken at AIC Litein Hospital from 1st November 2020 to 31st August 2022. Cases were defined as any consecutive patient managed with TT and consented to be included in the study. Those who declined to have TT, were referred, or died before TT were excluded. Informed consent was obtained by one or more of the general surgery residents prior to or after TT depending on the urgency of the procedure and the patient\u2019s overall condition. Patients were managed by general sur\u00ad geons with experience, but not specialization in thoracic surgery, and complex thoracic cases are typically referred to a nearby tertiary referral center. This observational study did not influence the management of the patients; thus, no patient received any additional care or benefit for accepting to be included, nor did any have withheld or lower quality care for refusing to participate in the study. Patients were managed based on their overall diagnosis, the attending surgeon\u2019s discretion, and a standardized tube thoracostomy protocol (appendix 1). Due to varied levels of clinicians in training (medical officer interns, junior and senior residents), TTs were preferentially placed within the triangle of safety at the fourth or fifth intercostal space uti\u00ad lizing the blunt dissection technique and supervised or per\u00ad formed by the attending surgeon. Chest tubes were con\u00ad nected to a three-compartment integrated disposable chest drainage unit. Due to resource limitations, these disposable units were reused after disinfection and disposed of when they were noted to malfunction or be broken. Suction was used only in patients with significant air leaks or poor lung expansion on chest radiography. Data from the patients were collected using a prestruc\u00ad tured questionnaire that included patients\u2019 demographics, clinical presentation, indications for TT, management, and outcome at discharge and at least four weeks post-TT. The outcome was defined as the resolution of the indication for TT, the presence or absence of complications related to TT placement, or inpatient mortality. Complications were categorized into five separate categories (insertional, posi\u00ad tional, infective/immunologic, removal, and equipment-re\u00ad lated) based on a validated classification methodology by Aho et al.9 Follow-up was done through perusal of the pa\u00ad tient\u2019s electronic medical records taken during clinic atten\u00ad dance and telephone review for those noted not to have at\u00ad tended clinic or whose last attendance date was less than four weeks post-TT. Data were abstracted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and results were summarized using descriptive statistics. We compared the duration of TT for patients with traumatic and non-traumatic indications using Students t-test. We compared the percentage of complications for each TT placed by residents and consultants using Chi-square analy\u00ad sis. Ethical approval was obtained before the initiation of the study by the Institutional Ethics and Research Commit\u00ad tee (IREC) (IREC/2020/4). This case series has been re\u00ad ported per the PROCESS guidelines.10 Results Demographics During the study period, 43 patients were noted to require TT; however, two declined to consent to be included in the study, one patient with empyema thoracis was referred prior to TT, and one patient with a large malignant pleural ef\u00ad fusion died prior to TT placement. Thus 39 patients were analyzed, who comprised 33 males and 6 females with a median age of 35 years (range 3-75). It was noted that 16 (41.02%) had health insurance coverage. Eight (20.51%) cases were referred from a peripheral facility. The most common symptoms noted before TT place\u00ad ment were chest pains, difficulty in breathing, and cough that were present for a median period of 6 hours (range, 1 hour to 60 days) and a mean duration of 4 days (95% CI 0.6-7.7). Trauma was noted in 28 patients secondary to as\u00ad sault (n=16 penetrating, n=1 blunt), road traffic collision (n=8), fall from a height (n=1), and ventilator-associated barotrauma (n=1). In addition, these patients had other as\u00ad sociated injuries, most commonly to the ribs, diaphragm, or spleen (table 1). Management A total of 45 TTs were placed for a median duration of 6 days (range 1-26) and a mean duration of 7.62 +/- 6.43 days. The majority (n=41, 91%) of TT were inserted in the\u00ad atre. Three were placed in the general surgical ward and one in the high dependency unit (HDU) for a patient with ia\u00ad trogenic pneumothorax (barotrauma) on mechanical venti\u00ad lation. Suction was selectively used in patients (empyema thoracis n=3, traumatic pneumothorax n=2) with significant air leak and poor lung expansion on chest radiography. Ul\u00ad trasonography was not available during the study period. In patients with a history of trauma (n=28), TTs were placed for hemopneumothorax (n=19, 48.7%), pneumothorax (n=6, 15.4%), and hemothorax (n=3, 7.7%). In those who did not have trauma (n=11), TTs were placed for empyema thoracis (n=8, 20.5%), large pleural effusion (n=2, 5.1%), and pneumothorax (n=1, 2.5%). Most TTs were placed by the attending surgeon (n=34), while residents placed 11 TTs under supervision. The initial TT was unilateral in 36 pa\u00ad tients and bilateral in three patients. In addition, three TTs required replacement due to blockage (n=2, all placed by the attending surgeon) or subcutaneous placement (n=1, placed by the resident). Three patients with empyema tho\u00ad racis were noted to have persistent air leak with poor lung expansion that did not improve on suction. These patients were subsequently referred to a tertiary facility for tho\u00ad racotomy (table 2). A malfunction of the integrated chest drainage unit was noted in four patients, and there was Indications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospecti\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 10 Table 1.

The sys\u00ad tem malfunction were noted within 12 to 24 hours of place\u00ad ment of the TT. The malfunction involved a leak in the wa\u00ad ter seal chamber in two patients, cracked connector in one patient, and one drainage system had two collection cham\u00ad bers that appeared separate, but one had to be sealed for proper function (as both were connected to the water seal and suction components). All these were noted early and corrected with no long-term or severe adverse effects to the patients. Outcome Patients were admitted for a median duration of 7 days (range, 1-32) and a mean duration of 8.69 +/- 5.65 days, with the end of hospitalization stratified as discharge (n=28, 71.8%), referral (n=7, 17.9%), or mortality (n=4, 10.2%). Referrals were for thoracotomy patients with a persistent air leak and poor lung expansion post-TT for empyema thoracis (n=3), isolation in a patient with COVID-19 post- TT (n=1), dialysis for worsening renal failure in a patient with blunt thoracoabdominal trauma (n=1), vascular injury in a patient with concomitant knee dislocation (n=1) and for bronchoscopy in a patient with tracheobronchial injury (n=1). Mortalities occurred within 1-3 days post-surgery in patients with blunt (n=2) or penetrating (n=2) thoracoab\u00ad dominal trauma that led to irreversible hemorrhagic shock (n=2) or multisystem organ failure (n=2). Excluding pa\u00ad tients who died, the duration of TT was shorter for patients who had trauma compared to those who did not (mean 5.71+/- 3.13 days, n=24 versus mean 13.82 +/-8.39 days, n=11, p 0.0002). Four patients scheduled for follow-up at the surgical clinic (n=28) did not show up, while five at\u00ad tended clinics less than four weeks post-TT. Four of these nine patients were successfully reached via phone and were doing well. The median number of clinic visits was 2 (range 1-6), while the median duration of follow-up post-TT was four weeks (range 2-23). Surgical site infection was noted in two patients during their clinic reviews within four weeks of discharge (Table 2). Overall, 14 morbidities were ob\u00ad served, with six occurring in 11 TTs placed by residents Indications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospecti\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 11 and eight occurring in 34 TTs placed by the general surgery consultants (p=0.053). Discussion This study aimed to describe the distribution of indications and pattern of complications of patients managed with TT at a single health facility in Kenya. The findings suggest that TT is predominantly used for trauma-related indica\u00ad tions, and the most common complication is equipment malfunction. We included 39 patients with a median age of 35 years, who had 45 TTs placed for a median duration of 6 days. A history of trauma was noted in most cases (n=28, 71.8%), with the predominant type being penetrat\u00ad ing trauma from assault (n=16, 41%). The most common indications for TT were hemopneumothorax (48.7% of all cases and 67.8% of those with trauma), empyema thoracis (20.5% of all cases and 72.7% of those without trauma), and pneumothorax (17.9% of all cases and 21.4% of pa\u00ad tients with a history of trauma). Four patients died due to pre-tube thoracostomy injuries, 14 (35.9%) morbidities were noted up to one-month post-discharge, while 5 (14.2%) patients were lost to follow-up. Significant variation was noted regarding the indications for TT from various studies within Africa. In a Nigerian study reviewing the use of TT in trauma patients at three major teaching hospitals, Makama et al. noted that the most common indications for TT were hemopneumothorax (43%), pneumothorax (30%), and hemothorax (27%). Sev\u00ad enty-five percent of the cases had blunt trauma.6 Likewise, in a study conducted at a high-volume trauma center in South Africa, Kong et al. noted that 75% of cases had pen\u00ad etrating trauma, and the TT indications were pneumothorax (38%), hemopneumothorax (30%) and hemothorax (30%).7 On the other hand, Edaigbini et al., in their review con\u00ad ducted at a facility in Nigeria that involved 26% of patients with trauma, noted malignant pleural effusion (27.5%), parapneumonic effusion (12%) and empyema thoracis (7%) as the most common indications for TT.2 Mefire et al., in their study from a regional facility in Cameroon, noted that 91% of the cases where TT was inserted had no history of trauma and non-purulent pleural effusion (69%) and empyema thoracis (12.69%) as the most common indica\u00ad tions for TT.5 Makanga et al., in their review from Kenya, noted pleural effusion (70%), pneumothorax (14%), and empyema thoracis (5%) as the most common TT indication. Patients with trauma comprised only 15% of cases.8 The findings in this study of the predominance of hemothorax, pneumothorax, or hemopneumothorax in patients with trauma, empyema thoracis, and pleural effusion in patients without a history of trauma as indications for TT is in keep\u00ad ing with prior studies, but highlights the importance of un\u00ad derstanding local and regional indications for TT. The reported mean duration of TT from various African studies is 5-13 days.2,4\u20116,8 Nwofor et al. correctly pointed to the difference in the resolution time of various pleural pathologies that impact the duration of TT.4 Thus, the dura\u00ad tion of TT for post-traumatic pneumothorax or hemothorax is expected to be shorter than for empyema thoracis. Indeed, patients with post-traumatic indications for TT in this study had a shorter mean duration of TT compared to those who had a non-traumatic indication (5.71 days vs. 13.82 days, p=0.0002) This study utilized the classification methodology devel\u00ad oped by Aho et al.9 This enabled us to have a uniform com\u00ad plication reporting system and evaluate the impact of equip\u00ad ment malfunction as the surgical department reused the single-use disposable commercial chest drainage unit to re\u00ad duce the overall cost to the patients. We have implemented a standardized check of the system with uniform testing prior to each use to limit equipment malfunction. It was noted that equipment malfunction contributed to 28% of the overall complication, but this may have been underre\u00ad ported. Residents were noted to have a higher rate of com\u00ad plications than the attending surgeons (54.5% vs. 23.5%), with subcutaneous placement and improper equipment set- up being the most preventable complications. As a teaching hospital, it is important that trainees receive proper super\u00ad vision and autonomy to achieve adequate case volumes to become competent surgeons.11,12 Improved complication recognition during critical time points and improved educa\u00ad tion on the performance of TT as well as proper equipment set-up will be beneficial.13 We recommend future empha\u00ad sis on training residents to ensure they are trained and cer\u00ad tified as competent in the set-up of the equipment in a dry lab simulation before using the equipment The overall com\u00ad plication rate in this study (35.9%) is much higher than re\u00ad ported by Edaigbini et al., at 17%, and by Mefire et al., at 19% but lower than reported by Nwofor et al., at 45%.2,4,5 The higher rate may be attributed to the addition of equip\u00ad ment malfunction and set up to complications that were not present in the other reviews. This series had a mortality rate of 14.2% in patients with thoracic trauma (n=28) and was attributed to trauma- related injuries and not TT itself. Similarly, Dayananda et al. note that thoracic trauma can lead to an overall mortality rate of up to 20% and higher with penetrating thoracic stab wounds.14 Limitations Our findings are limited by the relatively small sample size, a potential selection bias that may not represent the broader population of the region, and challenges in patient follow- up. In addition, the equipment malfunction may have been underreported. A multi-institutional study involving vari\u00ad ous hospitals from different regions in Kenya may better re\u00ad flect the indications and outcomes. Indications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospecti\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 12 Conclusions In this series, most patients had blunt or penetrating chest trauma, with hemopneumothorax being the most common indication for TT. Reuse of chest drainage systems con\u00ad tributed significantly to equipment failure, but the potential consequences on patient outcomes should be further ex\u00ad plored and compared to the costs of not reusing drainage systems.

This regional survey study aims to identify perceived barriers to policy formulation and, where applicable, implementation. Methods A combination of convenience, purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to distribute an electronic survey to SADC surgical care stakeholders. Adaptive questioning was utilised to evaluate perceived potential barriers by each respondent, including government support for national surgical policy, the existence of a taskforce, resourcing for policy development, and specific challenges mapped to domains of the National Surgical, Obstetric and Anaesthesia Plan (NSOAP) Manual. Results Of 182 participants that consented to participation, 60% (n=109) responded in full and 22% (n=40) logged a partial response that was included in the analysis. 14/16 SADC countries were represented. 60% of respondents identified as healthcare professionals, 23% were academics and 24% represented government; there was poor representation from NGOs, civil society and potential donors. Twenty-seven percent (n=32) of respondents indicated that their country\u2019s government supports and is driving the NSOAP development process. Financing (n=41, 82%) and stakeholder engagement (n=40, 80%) were the domains most commonly cited as barriers to developing a national surgical health plan. Respondents from three countries that had published NSOAPs cited inadequate integration into existing health plans and insufficient funding as common barriers to implementation. Conclusions There is a generalised perception of limited political conviction to drive national surgical improvement across the region, as well as funding and stakeholder engagement being significant barriers. For safe, timely, and affordable surgical care to become a reality, SADC governments need to exhibit strong leadership and engage potential funders (national treasury, This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

Introduction National Health Plans must include surgery, obstetric, and anaesthesia (SOA) services to achieve Universal Health Coverage.1,2 Recognition of this need has increased, with the Republic of Zambia, Republic of Tanzania, Madagas\u00ad car, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Namibia developing national surgical healthcare policies. However, other Southern African Development Community (SADC) Member States lag behind in policy development.3,4 National Surgical, Obstetrics and Anaesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) were proposed by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery as a policy framework that Ministries of Health could use to evaluate and strengthen their health sys\u00ad tems\u2019 capacity to deliver surgical, obstetric and anaesthetic (SOA) care.5 These plans align with Member State political commitments contained in World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 68.15, which affirmed the importance of safe, timely and affordable access to emergency and essential SOA care as a component of Universal Health Coverage.6 This commitment was recently reaffirmed with the adop\u00ad tion of WHA resolution 76.2.7 SADC Member States led the negotiations for the adoption of WHA68.15 and have committed to developing NSOAPs, sharing best practice through a \u2018peer review\u2019 mechanism that includes reporting progress at annual SADC Health Ministers\u2019 meetings and participation within the SADC Technical Experts\u2019 Working Group (SADC-TEWG) on SOA care. Of the 16 SADC Member States, 38% (n=6) have com\u00ad pleted NSOAP development, while 62% (n=10) are at dif\u00ad ferent stages of development of national surgical healthcare policies as reported at the monthly SADC-TEWG Situation Room meeting.8 Other African countries (Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Nigeria) have implemented similar poli\u00ad cies.9\u201111 Globally, the Western Pacific Region has also de\u00ad veloped a Regional Action Framework for National Surgi\u00ad cal Planning and Development,12 Pakistan has published a National Vision for Surgical Care13 and Ecuador has begun developing an NSOAP \u2013 the first in Latin America.14 De\u00ad spite many national surgical plans being created worldwide, only Ethiopia has performed an audit of the surgical health\u00ad care improvement policy\u2019s implementation process.15 Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, progress in NSOAP development has been slower than anticipated.16 With the expiry of the 2030 agenda for sustainable devel\u00ad opment approaching, it is important to elucidate barriers that impede the development and implementation of na\u00ad tional surgical healthcare policies. Information delineating enabling or delaying factors could prove critical in the for\u00ad mulation of strategies to support and accelerate surgical health policy formulation in the region, and inform direc\u00ad tions that other countries might take. This is a cross-sectional survey to identify barriers (lead\u00ad ership, political, economic, logistical, administrative, tech\u00ad nical or other) to NSOAP policy development and imple\u00ad mentation in the 16 SADC Member States. The primary aim is to describe the main barriers to NSOAP develop\u00ad ment. Secondary aims are to identify (1) facilitators of NSOAP development and (2) barriers to NSOAP imple\u00ad mentation. Methods Study design and participant inclusion criteria, survey in\u00ad strument design, survey dissemination and administration plan, analysis plan, and ethics approval are reported as per the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES), guidelines for reporting internet based e-sur\u00ad veys.17 Study Design and Participants This was a cross-sectional survey of stakeholders of surgi\u00ad cal care within SADC Member States. Invited stakeholder groups included - but were not limited to - government, hospital management, healthcare professionals, non-gov\u00ad ernmental organisations, academic institutions, profes\u00ad sional associations, World Health Organisation represen\u00ad tatives, and donors. There was no financial incentive; participation was purely voluntary. Participants were recruited using purposive, snowball, and convenience sampling. The initial recruitment phase was limited to recommended contacts within the SADC SOA community through the SADC-TEWG. Respondents suggested expanding access via various SOA-specific WhatsApp group platforms to improve participation. A sec\u00ad ond recruitment phase with an open survey link was launched, followed by a third phase of purposive follow-up of stakeholders from Member States that were under-repre\u00ad sented. Survey Instrument We designed a structured questionnaire (Appendix 1) com\u00ad prising the following sections: demographic information in\u00ad cluding country representation and stakeholder type; and respondents\u2019 perceptions of 1) government support for NSOAPs; 2) existence of an NSOAP task force; 3) re\u00ad sources for NSOAP development; and 4) NSOAP devel\u00ad opment as per the domains of the NSOAP manual18: a) situation analysis and baseline assessment; b) stakeholder engagement and priority setting; c) drafting and validation; Barriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 43 d) monitoring and evaluation; e) financing; and f) gover\u00ad nance. For those respondents from countries in which an NSOAP already existed, there was a section on implemen\u00ad tation. The survey was created in English. Translated versions were available via a Google Chrome plugin for respondents in Angola (Portuguese), DRC, and Comoros (French). Study data were collected, managed, and stored using se\u00ad cure REDCap software.19,20 Adaptive questioning utilising REDCap branching logic function was employed. The tool was piloted by three individuals outside the design team to refine the content, structure, branching logic, general use\u00ad ability and technical functionality before final dissemina\u00ad tion. The survey could be completed via computer or smart\u00ad phone. Utilisation of the adaptive questioning technique pre\u00ad cluded a completeness check. Completion of at least six questions was required for response inclusion; the maxi\u00ad mum number of questions was 76. The survey ranged from 2-14 sections (pages). Survey Dissemination and Administration Phase 1 occurred from September to October 2022. Known stakeholders within SADC were invited to participate via email. The survey was launched at a SADC-TEWG meet\u00ad ing and promoted via the SADC SOA WhatsApp group by its Chair and the study team. Phase 2, from November to December 2022, introduced an open recruitment process via WhatsApp to appropriate groups, e.g. the Zambian Surgeons\u2019 professional network, the Namibian NSOAP development group, and the Surgical Society of Botswana network. During phase 3 (January to February 2023), purposive recruitment of stakeholders from Member States that were underrepresented took place. These individuals were iden\u00ad tified and contacted via email and/or WhatsApp. We expressly permitted participants to complete the sur\u00ad vey more than once if responding for multiple member states. The risk for duplicate entries could theoretically not be excluded but there was no behavioural incentive for this. Analysis Responses were evaluated for completeness. Due to the adaptive questioning technique, survey length differed be\u00ad tween participants. If a participant had not completed the entirety of their bespoke survey, but had completed at least one section beyond demographic information, this was counted as a partial response and included in the analysis as such. Participants were counted as having completed the survey in entirety if they completed all fields up to and not including optional questions following the survey about continuing collaboration within the SADC-TEWG. We did not use weights to improve representativeness but conducted a post-hoc subgroup analysis of responses from the Republic of Zambia, as these accounted for 38% Figure 1. Flowchart of responses of the responses. Entries that did not have a minimum de\u00ad mographic data set (SADC Member State and stakeholder group) were excluded from analysis. Data were de-iden\u00ad tified prior to analysis. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted using Microsoft Excel for quantitative data. A thematic analysis for major themes was carried out for qual\u00ad itative responses. Ethics IRB exemption was determined by the Institutional Review Board of Harvard Medical School (IRB22-0262), and full ethics approval granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Witwatersrand University (HREC: M220250). A participant information sheet was included as the initial page of the survey, requiring affirmative consent before the survey could proceed. Only the research team had access to the REDCap database. Results Response and completion rates In phase 1, individualised survey links were sent to 342 unique email addresses. Of these, 55 logged at least a partial response, equating to a response rate of 16%. This prompted phase 2 and 3 of recruitment. Following all recruitment phases, 216 participants opened the survey and 84% (n=182) completed at least the consent form. Completion rate was 60% (109/182). An ad\u00ad ditional 40 participants recorded partial responses. Over the three periods of data collection, 149 partial and complete responses were obtained (Figure 1). Respondent Demographics Responses were obtained from 87% (n=14) of countries; there were no responses obtained from Mauritius or Mozambique. Figure 2 graphically presents country-level representation. Respondents represented the following stakeholders: 60% health care professionals (n=90), 24% government (n=36) and 23% academic institutions (n=34). Of 149 respondents, 30% (n=45) respondents held member\u00ad ships in multiple stakeholder groups (median 1; range 2-5) Barriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 44 Figure 2.

Percentages are calculated from n=149 total responses. and two responded \u2018other\u2019 but did not provide an alterna\u00ad tive affiliation (Table 1). 140 participants responded to the question, \u2018Are you satisfied with the overall quality of sur\u00ad gical services in your country?\u2019 of which 93% said that they were not. Although respondents were often self-identified members of professional and governmental groups, all re\u00ad sponses were analysed as representing the viewpoint of the individual rather than any organisation. Free text responses to \u2018strengths and weaknesses\u2019 questions The survey requested that respondents express at least one strength and one weakness of surgical services in their country. Responses were categorised thematically into re\u00ad sponses regarding infrastructure, SOA staffing, and out\u00ad comes. In terms of strengths, respondents were optimistic about the breadth and availability of procedures: 25% (n=31/124) respondents commented on availability of sur\u00ad gical procedures and operating theatre space, increasingly at district (level 1) or regional/provincial (level 2) hospitals. Further, 11% (n=14) respondents commented on the exis\u00ad tence of a referral system and access to tertiary level care. Twenty-seven percent (n=34) of respondents indicated ad\u00ad equate numbers of staff exist, and that the number of spe\u00ad cialists, specialist training, and basic surgical training for non-specialist doctors was increasing. Ten percent (n=12) of respondents commented on the commitment and passion of specialists to provide SOA care. Another strength was the reported low- or no-cost surgical services for impover\u00ad ished patients through government-led health programmes, which was mentioned in 7% (n=9) of responses. Challenges regarding infrastructure, equipment and medical-surgical supply challenges were the most reported weakness. Twenty-eight percent (n=40/143) respondents cited inadequate, obsolete diagnostic and surgical equip\u00ad ment and 17% (n=24) reported a lack of consumables and medications as weaknesses of their surgical systems. In addition, 17% (n=24) commented on the persistent low number of specialist doctors and specialised ancillary staff, including nurses and scrub technicians. Respondents also flagged challenges with inequitable distribution of surgical services between urban and rural regions, between rural re\u00ad gions, and an overall lack of policy or guidelines regard\u00ad ing quality and provision of care. Despite the increasing scope of procedures offered, respondents indicated that ter\u00ad tiary centres were overwhelmed and there were long wait- times for emergency and elective procedures. One respon\u00ad dent wrote of \u2018significant waiting times both for elective as well as emergency surgeries. Many patients do not have ad\u00ad equate access to surgical services and the delay contributes to morbidity and mortality\u2019. Interestingly, three respondents reported that reliance on private health systems resulted in lack of investment in public systems and thus poor quality of care for the uninsured population. One respondent stated: \u2018There is [a] HUGE gap between state (government) and private health care. Almost 88% patients use state facilities and only 12% private facilities. The resource allocation is less than 12% for government patients\u2019. Political Landscape, Task Force Development, and Resources When asked about perceptions of the political will sur\u00ad rounding NSOAP development and implementation, 47% (n=56/119) stated that their government supported NSOAP development \u2018a little\u2019. Twenty-seven percent (n=32) re\u00ad ported that their government \u2018supports and is driving\u2019 the NSOAP development process. There were 135 responses with 30% (n=41) responding \u2018unknown\u2019 to whether a task force for NSOAP develop\u00ad ment existed in their country. Of the other responses, 28% Barriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 45 (n=35) believed that the NSOAP Development Task Force was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and 21% (n=28) believed that key members of the task force were redirected to COVID-19 efforts. Twenty-one percent of re\u00ad spondents (n=28) reported no task force existed in their respective countries. Reasons cited were \u2018no champion to lead the NSOAP process\u2019, \u2018not enough interested people to create a task force\u2019, '\u2018stakeholders have competing interests preventing the formation of a cohesive working group\u2019 and \u2018lack of focus\u2019. Where there was a task force, 61% (n=40) reported coordination between members. Stakeholders were asked to select which entities they believed provided financial and/or personnel resources for NSOAP development (Figure 3). Eight different potential sources of resources were offered (as well as the options of \u2018none\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019). Forty-three percent of respondents (n=64) reported provision of personnel resources; within this group, the median number of selected sources was 3 (range 1-8) and total number of selections was 190. Per\u00ad sonnel assistance included support for data collection, pol\u00ad icy drafting, advocacy efforts, and similar tasks. Personnel resources were perceived to be sourced from national gov\u00ad ernments (24%, n=45), domestic universities (20%, n=38), foreign universities (14%, n=27), and the SADC-TEWG (11%, n=21). Thirty-five percent of respondents (n=52) re\u00ad ported financial provision. Within this group, the median number of selected sources was 2 (range 1-5) and the total number of selections was 103. National government con\u00ad stituted 25% (n=26) of selections; WHO constituted 23% (n=24), and international organisations like the World Bank constituted 16% (n=16). Free text responses to factors that affected political support of NSOAP development Free text answers were elicited in response to the question \u2018Please specify any other factors that may have influenced political support of NSOAP development, and whether this has resulted in an increase or decrease in support of NSOAP development\u2019. Respondents listed factors that they believed both increased and decreased political support fairly equally. With regards to decreasing support, the most com\u00ad monly cited reasons were high turnover of key personnel in government positions and other health priorities (including COVID-19) taking precedence over SOA care. Other fac\u00ad tors cited were decreasing donor support, other political pri\u00ad orities (e.g. eastern DRC conflict), and lack of awareness of SOA care needs. Regarding factors that increased political support for NSOAP development, the most commonly re\u00ad ported was the dedication of leadership and advocacy teams and personnel in putting pressure on the government. One respondent wrote, \u2018The resilience of the technical team in advocating for NSOAP development and implementation has influenced the political leadership to pay more atten\u00ad tion\u2019. Others cited external pressure from NGOs to increase access to SOA care, as well as restructuring of governmen\u00ad tal agencies and human resources providing increased ca\u00ad pacity toward NSOAP development. NSOAP Development Barriers Respondents were asked whether an NSOAP process had been initiated in their country; of 73 respondents, 68% (n=50) said the process had been initiated, 8% (n=6) that it had not been initiated, and 23% (n=17) were unsure. The 50 respondents who were aware of an NSOAP process be\u00ad ing initiated in their countries were asked to indicate which of the following domains presented challenges in NSOAP development: situational analysis and baseline assessment; stakeholder engagement and priority setting; drafting and validation; monitoring and evaluation; finance; governance; or none. Figure 4 provides a detailed account of all re\u00ad sponses and the specific components of each domain that presented a challenge in the NSOAP development process. Financing, stakeholder engagement and priority setting, and situational analysis and baseline assessment were the three categories that were most often cited as having presented challenges to NSOAP development. NSOAP Implementation Three countries had begun NSOAP implementation at the time of survey distribution: Zambia, Tanzania, and Mada\u00ad gascar. Participant stakeholders from these countries were asked about barriers to implementation in addition to bar\u00ad riers to development. Of these, there were 34 responses regarding Ministry of Health support for implementation: 59% (n=20) reported that the Ministry of Health supported implementation \u2018a little\u2019, and 26% (n= 9) reported that the Ministry of Health \u2018supports and is driving the NSOAP im\u00ad plementation process.\u2019 In response to the question \u2018Has im\u00ad plementation gone to plan?\u2019 zero respondents said \u2018yes\u2019, 21% (n=6) of 28 said \u2018no\u2019, and 50% (n=14) said \u2018partially\u2019. The six respondents who responded \u2018no\u2019 and 12/14 \u2018par\u00ad tially\u2019 responses were submitted by Zambian respondents, as well as the majority of responses regarding implementa\u00ad tion barriers (90%, n=18/20). Of eight potential barriers, re\u00ad spondents indicated that seven were applicable (with 7-10 responses for each) in their context. Mirroring the stated barriers for NSOAP development, there were issues around finance and personnel resources as well as inadequate lead\u00ad ership and governance. However, there were additional im\u00ad plementation barriers around the NSOAP not being trans\u00ad lated into an actionable plan, and inadequate integration of the NSOAP into the National Health Strategic Plans (NHSP). Notably, unlike the responses to the questions about barriers to NSOAP development, respondents from all 3 countries (Zambia, Madagascar, and Tanzania) said that COVID-19 did, in fact, divert resources from NSOAP implementation (Figure 5).

Regarding positive effects of NSOAP im\u00ad plementation, or positive changes in the status of SOA care in their country since implementation was due to start, 18% reported benefits in improved access to emergency surgical care (n=13/72), 21% reported improved provider workforce with regards to SAO specialists (n=15) and 13% with re\u00ad gard to non-specialists including nurses (n=9). Eleven per\u00ad cent (n=8) reported that there has not been any positive change in surgical care since their NSOAP was published. Negative aspects of NSOAP Development or Negative Changes in Surgical Health Care Respondents were asked about the negative effects of NSOAP development and implementation, as well as other negative changes to surgical systems they have perceived since the time NSOAP implementation began. There were no responses from Madagascar and Tanzania; a few free- text responses were given by Zambian respondents. These responses included concerns about lack of specialist train\u00ad ing, decreased number of specialists compared to increasing workload, lack of funding for operations and need for pa\u00ad tients to purchase their own surgical supplies, and depleted surgical support services leading to increased case cancella\u00ad tions. On a structural level, one respondent reported a lack of engagement and advocacy for surgical healthcare at the community level. Zambia Subgroup Analysis Since 38% (n=56) of the 149 total responses were reported for Zambia, these responses were analysed separately as a subgroup as well as within the complete response analyses reported above. Responses in all categories closely mir\u00ad rored the responses received for the entire cohort. A com\u00ad parison of the responses from the Zambian subgroup and the total dataset are reported in Figure 7. Regarding resources, respondents perceived higher pro\u00ad vision of personnel resources (n=48) than financial re\u00ad sources (n=30). Likewise, personnel resources were per\u00ad ceived as being supplied by the national government (31%, n=15) and universities (33%, n=16), whereas financial re\u00ad sources were perceived to be supplied by WHO (17%, n=5), foreign governments (23%, n=7), or other interna\u00ad tional organisations e.g. the World Bank (23%, n=7). Two other sources of personnel resources mentioned were surgi\u00ad cal societies and the Zambia Medical Association. Regarding implementation of Zambia\u2019s NSOAP, 12 of the respondents reported being involved with the imple\u00ad mentation process and 23 reported that they were not in\u00ad volved.

Discussion Government decision agendas depend on the alignment of problem, policy, and political streams.21 Concerning surgi\u00ad cal healthcare, the problem remains as urgent as ever, so an opening of a policy window relies on having enough governmental political will to drive successful policy re\u00ad form. The gains are potentially far-reaching: the top-down directive to strengthen a surgical system would ultimately strengthen the entire national health system.22 However, our survey results indicate the perception of limited po\u00ad litical conviction for national surgical healthcare policy in many SADC Member States. Taken at face value, it raises the question of why there is so little impetus to strengthen SOA care. This study was not designed to explore that spe\u00ad cific issue, but Mhazo et al have specifically looked into the \u2018lack of political will\u2019 for health reform in sub-Saharan Africa, elucidating more specific drivers: \u20181) the distribu\u00ad tion of costs and benefits arising from policy reforms, 2) the form and expression of power among actors, 3) the desire to win or stay in government, 4) political ideologies, 5) elite interests and 6) policy diffusion\u2019.23 Other potential factors include a lack of state capacity24 in LMIC governments and potentially a lack of lobbying power.25 However, this study indicates that where there is an existing strategy to incorpo\u00ad rate adequate minimal standards for surgical care within the national health plan, the key driver has been perceived as established leadership of the process within the Ministry of Health. In terms of the technical process of NSOAP formulation, finance was the most commonly cited component that pre\u00ad sented difficulty. This was principally thought to be due to the absence of an allocated budget for surgical system strengthening within the Ministry of Health and a lack of accurate costing data. Notably, there were relatively few respondents who thought that a lack of economics or fi\u00ad nancial expertise was the main cause. Most respondents re\u00ad ported being unaware how the NSOAP process was being resourced. It is no surprise that finance was perceived as the greatest challenge; LMICs are, by definition, resource-lim\u00ad ited; and much of sub-Saharan Africa continues to be reliant on external aid to finance healthcare services.26,27 Further\u00ad more, formulating a policy without the certainty of funding for implementation might be perceived by the electorate as Barriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 48 Figure 5. Barriers to NSOAP implementation: Respondents from Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar Figure 6. Facilitators of NSOAP Development an empty or broken promise and compromise the prospect of re-election for the sitting government. Stakeholder engagement was the second most com\u00ad monly cited challenge. Within this theme, there have been difficulties engaging with key stakeholders from both pub\u00ad lic and private sectors, and agreeing who these key stake\u00ad holders are. Another highlighted difficulty is competing in\u00ad terests between key stakeholders. Given the diversity of stakeholders, it goes without question that different goals exist for SOA care delivery and development. Within this diverse cohort, there must be intentionality in the choices made regarding which voices to include and which to pri\u00ad oritise. This can only happen if clear government leadership of the process is established. Voluntary participation inevitably gives rise to self-se\u00ad lection bias; 60% of respondents were healthcare providers, Barriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 49 Figure 7. Comparison of Zambian Subgroup Responses vs All SADC Responses in Demographics, Policy Support and Leadership, and Development Barriers. 24% represented government and 23% from academic insti\u00ad tutions (with overlap of these cohorts), but there was min\u00ad imal representation from intergovernmental organisations (such as the World Bank and World Health Organisation) and no representation from donor agencies or private in\u00ad dustry. This could relate to dissemination techniques, and/ or the level of engagement from these stakeholders with re\u00ad gard to NSOAP development. The authors re-evaluated the initial closed survey methodology in light of the low re\u00ad sponse rate (16%) and general feedback from participants but ultimately, responses were limited to what networks could be accessed. Frontline healthcare providers would be unlikely to access networks of the private sector, potential donors, government treasury and intergovernmental organ\u00ad isations, to whom the authors also lacked direct access. The lack of engagement with these sectors is in itself a barrier. As previously highlighted, innovative plans to incorporate surgical care into national health care cannot be formulated and implemented without appropriate fund\u00ad ing, making potential funders (both domestic and interna\u00ad tional) some of the most influential stakeholders. However, they are notably absent from the discussion. Furthermore, there was no representation of civil society among the re\u00ad spondents. To our knowledge, patient representative groups have not been formally consulted for any of the six pre\u00ad viously-published national surgical plans in the SADC re\u00ad gion. Self-selection bias and dissemination via the WhatsApp platform also resulted in uneven representation from differ\u00ad ent countries within SADC, with Zambia providing 38% of the total responses whilst none were elicited from Mozam\u00ad bique or Mauritius. The diversity between SADC Member States should not be underestimated, and thus skewed rep\u00ad resentation is a significant limitation. The post-hoc sub\u00ad analysis of Zambian responses was performed to address this, which largely reflected the findings of the overall co\u00ad hort. There was one notable difference in that financing was the third most cited barrier to development rather than the first. This finding could be due to the leadership and en\u00ad gagement of the Zambian Ministry of Health in the NSOAP development process, and local funding was made available for policy development, overcoming immediate financial barriers. The implication of this study is that advocating for na\u00ad tional surgical healthcare policy to be formulated is not sufficient to achieve policy development, much less im\u00ad plementation and achieving measurable impact on popu\u00ad lation health. The financial barrier is the most significant, and there are lessons to learn from the wider Global Health community in this regard. Firstly, the priority should be to increase domestic government health financing for obvious sustainability reasons28; but secondly, donor agencies (such as PEPFAR and the Global Fund) have been transformative in recent decades.29,30 The surgical community has much to learn from the positive impact of such funds, as well as the unintended negative consequences on health systems31 which should be mitigated against. It follows that the next step is to engage decision makers and funders (national treasury, intergovernmental and non-governmental organi\u00ad sations, philanthropies, private industry, etc.) from the very beginning, and align their interests to envision a sustainable financing model for surgical healthcare. Barriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 50 The NSOAP Manual,18 in its static form, is intended to be a template to guide LMICs through the technical process of creating a policy to address lack of access to emer\u00ad gency and essential surgical, obstetric, and anaesthesia care, including trauma, critical and perioperative nursing care. Whilst many countries have embarked upon this process, lack of robust monitoring and evaluation processes with standardised metrics has made it difficult to gauge what im\u00ad pact this has made on surgical healthcare provision. The end goal of any intervention in the global surgery space is to increase access to and quality of surgical healthcare. Pol\u00ad icy formulation is a vehicle to support that aim, rather than an end in itself. In order to ensure that national surgical planning process achieves the goals of improved surgical healthcare for all, it is critical to incorporate ongoing eval\u00ad uation of the policy against its stated goals as part of its de\u00ad velopment process. Conclusions Among LMICs, development of national strategies and spe\u00ad cific plans to implement appropriate levels of surgical healthcare has been slow. In seeking to delineate barriers (and appreciating inter-country variability), financing and political will have emerged as the most commonly cited challenges within SADC. Decision makers and potential funders should be engaged early, to envision a sustainable financing model for surgical healthcare.

Extra-ocular extension is rare, but the risk of systemic metastasis increases with late diagnosis. We report a case of retinoblastoma metastasis to the forearm six years after the first diagnosis was made and treated. It is believed to add to our understanding of retinoblastoma metastasis, and this relatively uncommon disease course. Introduction Retinoblastoma is the most common childhood intraocular malignant tumor.1,2 The majority of global case burden comes from low and middle-income countries associated with guarded outcomes.3 Retinoblastoma can be heritable secondary to germ-line mutation of the RB1 gene. This pat\u00ad tern is common in the early years of life and is mostly unilateral, unlike a non-heritable form which appears later. Several studies revealed that retinoblastoma affects nearly 1 in 16,000 \u2013 18,000 births, with an incidence of 7000 \u2013 8000 new cases yearly. The incidence is three times higher in children under five than in those under three.4 The mean age of diagnosis for retinoblastoma is around 1 year old for bilateral and 2 years for unilateral disease.5 A nationwide study in Uganda revealed a 45% 3-year survival rate com\u00ad pared to 100 % in countries with no resource limitation.6 The incidence of retinoblastoma is around 2310 in East Africa second only to the West Africa region with 7824 incidences. There is a trend towards delayed presentation and diagnosis, treatment discontinuity by the family, and significant gap in multidisciplinary treatment resulting in increased risk of disease relapse, systemic metastasis and poorer prognosis with a mortality of 40-70 % in low income countries.7 Clinical presentation of patients includes white ocular reflex, decreased vision, eye pain, and Glaucoma.8 Microscopic histological examinations show small hyper\u00ad chromatic cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio with multifocal areas of necrosis and calcification. Tumor invasion of the surrounding structures appears as solid nests of cells infiltrating surrounding borders, and no necrosis.9 Patients with delayed diagnosis have a higher risk of developing metastatic disease, and studies have shown ex\u00ad traocular retinoblastoma occurring at a mean age of 33 and 38 months. Extrascleral extension of primary tumors is the most important risk factor for distant metastasis, due to ac\u00ad cess to the vascular and lymphatic system outside the eye.5 Nearly all retinal recurrences appear within three years of the initial treatment and follow-up, with a 6-45% recur\u00ad rence following all options of initial treatment.10,11 It can also spread to the bones and lymph nodes and unlike all the other malignancies, rarely to the lungs.4 Bilateral tumours are discovered and treated at a younger age than unilateral Retinoblastoma.

Examination revealed a mildly ten\u00ad der, firm circumferential swelling over the distal third of the left forearm, her distal neurovascular status was normal and comparable to the right side (Figure 1). She has a surgically enucleated eye on the left side, with no other significant findings elicited. Imaging of the forearm revealed a perme\u00ad ative lesion over the whole length of the radius suggesting a possible presentation of osteosarcoma and she was subse\u00ad quently admitted for open biopsy (Figure 2). Her medical history begins with an initial presentation to an ophthalmology clinic with a complaint of bilateral eye leucorrhoea at 11 months of age. After a diagnosis of extensive intraocular retinoblastoma was made both eyes were surgically enucleated. The initial pathology report of the surgically removed eyes and tumour showed retinoblas\u00ad toma with extension to the uveal tract, and no involvement of the optic nerve. Post-operatively 6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy regimen including Vincristin, Etoposide, and Carboplatin was given for its high-risk pathology. Subse\u00ad quently, a follow-up MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) showed no radiologic evidence of recurrence or residual en\u00ad hancing tumor in the orbit, or signs of intracranial involve\u00ad ment (Fig 3). At the age of 4 years and 3 months, she came back with a complaint of left eye swelling. A computed Tomography (CT) scan showed a left eye globe soft tissue mass sug\u00ad gestive of Retinoblastoma and was treated with External Beam radiotherapy for 3 weeks. A year into her follow up she came with an acute lower back pain radiating down to her thighs bilaterally, neck swelling, and difficulty walk\u00ad ing.

Bone marrow biopsy was taken which demonstrated normal tri\u00ad lineage hematopoiesis, and Thoraco-Lumbar spinal MRI was suggestive of vertebral metastasis evidenced by L2 vertebral collapse (Fig 4). In light of the new diagnosis of vertebral and Lymph node metastasis, she was treated with high-dose intravenous dexamethasone, and 6 cycles of combination chemo-radio therapy including vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamid, and MESNA. The patient had no residual complications from the vertebral metastasis, and systemic studies didn\u2019t show involvement of other body parts. After 14 months of the new development, she started de\u00ad veloping left forearm pain, and swelling. During her initial admission, an incisional biopsy was done and histological sections were indicative of a round blue cell tumour likely retinoblastoma (Fig 5).

Discussion Local eye-preserving therapies such as radiotherapy have been shown to increase the risk for secondary cancers, com\u00ad monly sarcomas in the field of radiation. Since 1996 sys\u00ad temic chemotherapy replaced radiotherapy due to its con\u00ad cern of inducing secondary cancers, especially if alkylating agents are used.13 The most frequent site for distant metas\u00ad tases, through the systemic blood flow, is the bone marrow which may appear as primary bone tumours and needs to be carefully investigated.14 Both Focal and diffuse involve\u00ad ment of bones and bone marrow can occur, most commonly within two years of diagnosis as metastases in later years are extremely rare. Retinoblastoma patients are known to have an increased risk of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) like osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, rhabdomyosar\u00ad coma, angiosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and PNET (Primitive neuro-ectodermal tumours), typically occurring after 8\u201315 years of latency. Thorough investigations using histologi\u00ad cal, immunologic, and imaging is required to distinguish between these two entities. The Involvement of multiple bones supports the diagnosis of metastases than multifocal SMN.14,15 Metastatic retinoblastoma outside the Central Nervous System is rare and diagnosis is hard due to similar his\u00ad tologic appearance with other bone tumours.16 Metastases to extremities appear radiologicaly as permeative bone de\u00ad struction and periosteal reaction with a tendency to be bilat\u00ad eral.17 Histologically they present as small round or polyg\u00ad onal cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. They typically form rosettes where tumour cells surround a central basement membrane called Flexner- Wintersteiner rosettes. Both local and distance metastasis with intracranial extension including treatment-induced secondary tumors are known to be poor prognostic charac\u00ad teristics.18 Metastatic retinoblastoma has been rarely cur\u00ad able, a reason for the poor prognosis associated with metas\u00ad tasis. This is changing recently with the advent of a multimodal treatment including multi-agent chemotherapy, and radiotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation followed by high-dose chemotherapy to consolidate the re\u00ad sponse, as seen from different case series.19 Bilateral Retinoblastoma with Lumbar Spine and Forearm Metastasis, Six Years after the Initial Presentatio\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 6 Fig 5. Sections showing nests and sheets of moderately pleomorphic round blue cells with infiltration of the bony trabecular spaces, features suggest round blue cell tumor. Studies have shown initial diagnosis before two years of age and subretinal seeds at diagnosis to be predictive of re\u00ad currence.11 It is evident that our patient\u2019s age during her initial presentation has increased her risk of recurrence and the authors believe there might be a possibility of missed sub-retinal seeding initially. Due to her initial treatment with radiotherapy and alkylating agents, she is also believed to have an equal risk for developing secondary tumors in\u00ad cluding osteosarcoma, which is an important differential. As seen in this case having access to advanced histological investigations including immune histo-chemistry studies is critical in differentiating between the possible causes in such presentation. Repeated exposure to radiation including from an Initial treatment with external beam radiotherapy, and repeated radiologic investigations is related to an in\u00ad creased risk of recurrence especially in children with hered\u00ad itary retinoblastoma. Thus new recommendations include minimizing repeated exposure to imaging modalities, opt\u00ad ing for MRI as an initial evaluation tool instead of a CT scan, and utilizing alternative conservative measures is in place.20 Even if new and advanced treatment regimens are not readily available in this setting we believe local control of the disease process and post-surgical chemotherapy will give patients the best possible outcome. We have also ob\u00ad served delays in reaching a definitive diagnosis, and the lack of a multi-disciplinary approach to treat such patients has a direct impact on the prognosis of our patients. In ad\u00ad dition, evidences suggests lifelong follow-up of children treated for retinoblastoma is warranted to help children with societal integration, follow-up of late recurrences, and parental counseling for genetic testing.21 Physicians in re\u00ad source-limited settings are encouraged to advocate for the establishment of early detection facilities, and lifelong fol\u00ad low-up plans for patients with retinoblastoma. CONCLUSION In conclusion it is important to consider recurrence of retinoblastoma in patient with new onset swelling in un\u00ad usual sites even after years of their initial presentation. It is also important to have lifelong follow up for children with retinoblastoma in order to timely diagnose and treat patients.

While the overall global incidence and mortality of CRC have declined due to population-based screening programs, the rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) in individuals under 50 has increased sharply. The reasons behind this alarming trend remain unclear. Although hereditary cancer syndromes can predispose individuals to EOCRC, the majority of these cases are sporadic, and known lifestyle risk factors such as diet, smoking, and alcohol alone do not fully explain the rise. This phenomenon is global and affects both males and females. A low clinical index of suspicion in young adults often leads to delayed diagnosis, resulting in the detection of CRC at advanced stages, which contributes to poorer outcomes, particularly in younger patients. In this case report, we describe a 19-year-old male who presented with acute abdominal distention and bloody diarrhea. Imaging revealed an obstructive colorectal tumor with extensive metastasis to the mesentery, omentum, liver, stomach, and anterior abdominal wall. An emergency colostomy was performed to relieve the obstruction, but the patient ultimately succumbed to the aggressive nature of the disease nine days later. This case underscores the importance of recognizing colorectal cancer in young patients and raises awareness of the need for early diagnosis and intervention. By increasing vigilance for EOCRC in both primary and tertiary care settings, healthcare providers can improve patient outcomes through timely referrals and treatment. BACKGROUND Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) constitutes aggressive cancers of the colon and rectum, and it is the third most common cancer among men and the second most common among women globally. CRC incidence varies globally, with the highest incidence reported in developed countries.1 How\u00ad ever, recent data shows that CRC incidence rates in de\u00ad veloping countries, including African countries, are on the rise.2 Several factors have been attributed to the increase in incidence rates, including genetic predisposition, dietary practices such as increased intake of energy-dense foods, urbanization associated with a sedentary lifestyle, and obe\u00ad sity.1,2 CRC in children and young adults has been reported to not be common albeit in a few cases that have been re\u00ad ported. It has been estimated that 1\u20132 children and/or ado\u00ad lescents are diagnosed with CRC in 1 million people glob\u00ad ally. However, the incidence appears to be increasing.3 It is estimated that only 1% of all CRC occur in patients less than 30 years.4 The age-adjusted incidence rate of CRC in the population of adults is said to be 43.7 people per 1 million. A trend of increasing incidence of CRC has been observed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 Our recent works in northern Tanzania found a higher incidence of CRC in younger individuals, and 90% of the patients presented with advanced disease stages, hence the poor prognosis.5\u20117 CRCs are generally rare among teens especially in the ab\u00ad sence of known risk factors such as a positive family his\u00ad tory of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, familial adeno\u00ad matous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome.2 The clinical features are generally similar in all This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(3):9-15. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i3.3 ages, but CRC is easily overlooked among the differentials in young patients.2 Other general risk factors for CRC are smoking, obesity, race, diet and old age. Mucinous carcinomas account for 5-10% of all primary CRCs.1 It is defined by WHO as \u2018an adenocarcinoma in which a substantial amount of mucin (>50% of the tumor) is retained within the tumor\u2019. In the past, a myriad of de\u00ad scriptive terms has been used to indicate the mucin-pro\u00ad ducing phenotype, including colloid carcinoma, gelatinous carcinoma, or degenerative carcinoma. Mucinous adenocar\u00ad cinomas are clinically, morphologically, and molecularly different from conventional adenocarcinomas, and affect younger individuals, and they are more likely to be asso\u00ad ciated with Lynch syndrome (LS).8 Mucinous adenocarci\u00ad nomas are a histological subtype of CRC characterized by secreting extracellular mucin. Mucinous adenocarcinomas are divided into two categories: (i) extracellular subtype; is characterized by tumor cells floating freely in large pools of mucin. The cells that are floating in the mucin often have a bland histologic appearance. (ii) intracellular sub\u00ad type; is morphologically identical to the signet cell can\u00ad cer seen in the stomach. The signet cell variant behaves very aggressively, and it has a poor prognosis.8,9 Mucinous adenocarcinomas, including signet cell cancers, account for approximately 10% of colorectal cancers. Compared with non-mucinous CRCs, mucinous carcinomas usually present at a more advanced stage, they have more extensive perirec\u00ad tal spread, they show a greater incidence of lymph node in\u00ad volvement, and they tend to have an overall poorer prog\u00ad nosis.8 Among the mucinous tumors, the extracellular type is much more common than the intracellular, or signet cell type. Mucinous tumors are characterized by the overexpres\u00ad sion of the mucin gene MUC2 and the more frequent ec\u00ad topic expression of gastric mucin MUC5AC, which is me\u00ad diated by the transcription factor SOX2. The overexpression of MUC2 is driven by the hypomethylation of the MUC2 promoter, contributing to the mucin-produc\u00ad ing phenotype seen in these tumors. This molecular sig\u00ad nature is important for understanding the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets in mucinous tumors.9 The prognostic value of mucinous histology remains controver\u00ad sial, however, several literatures report they are associated with poor prognosis.8 Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is most commonly found in the proximal colon, where it is frequently diag\u00ad nosed at more advanced stages, contributing to its poorer prognosis. The larger calibre of the proximal colon allows tumors to grow significantly before symptoms appear. Ad\u00ad ditionally, mucinous adenocarcinomas are reported to have a poorer response to chemotherapy compared to non-muci\u00ad nous variants.10 Our case is unusual as the mucinous adeno\u00ad carcinoma was located distally, highlighting a rare presen\u00ad tation of this pathology. MRI is usually helpful in detecting this unusual CRC as they characterized by a low signal intensity in T1-weighted images and a significant hyper\u00ad intense signal in T2-weighted images. Non-mucinous col\u00ad orectal adenocarcinoma displays an intermediate signal in\u00ad tensity in T2-weighted images on the other hand. On CT scan, they are typically distinguished by a thickened in\u00ad testinal wall, a thickened gut mucosa, and the presence of low-density cystic lesions. Additionally, these tumors show non-significant enhancement in the arterial phase compared to normal muscle, aiding in their identification and differ\u00ad entiation from other types of CRC.10 LS is characterized by predisposition to colorectal, en\u00ad dometrial, and other cancers and is caused by inherited pathogenic variants affecting the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. LS1 and LS2 are both associated with MMR malfunction and mi\u00ad crosatellite instability.11 The prognosis is generally poor in the pediatric group, as reported in the literature, however, little has been published.8 Herein, we present an uncommon case of advanced mucinous CRC in a teenager. CASE PRESENTATION A 19-year-old male patient was referred to our facility from a primary health care facility with a presentation of ab\u00ad dominal distension for 3 weeks accompanied by early sati\u00ad ety and bloody diarrhea. The symptoms were progressive. These symptoms were preceded by a 5-month history of di\u00ad arrhea, intermittent episodes of constipation, and uninten\u00ad tional weight loss. During the illness, he tried various over- the-counter medications without relief. His past medical history was otherwise unremarkable. There was no familial history of gastrointestinal/breast/endometrial/prostate can\u00ad cers, and he denied a history of consuming alcohol and to\u00ad bacco. On physical examination, he was conscious, afebrile, mildly pale, not jaundiced, with bilateral pitting lower limb edema. He was wasted and undernourished as most of his bonny prominences were appreciated. The vital signs were within normal limits. His abdomen was grossly distended, non-tender, no organomegaly, hypertympanic on percus\u00ad sion, and exaggerated bowel sounds were appreciated on auscultation. On rectal examination, a hard mass easily bleeding and completely obstructing the distal rectum was felt hence could not go above it and was approximately 6cm from the anal verge. A respiratory examination revealed re\u00ad duced air entry on the left side with a dull percussion note. Investigations His complete blood count showed a hemoglobin of 9.4 g/ dl (microcytic and hypochromic), leucocyte count of 9.22 \u00d7 109/l and a platelet count of 142\u00d7109/L. A plain chest x- ray revealed approximately 50% left pleural effusion (Fig\u00ad ure 1), and abdominal-pelvic ultrasound concluded ascites, an ill-defined heterogenous pelvic mass with mild ascites. A contrasted CT-scan of the chest and abdomen showed symmetrical mural wall thickening measuring 4.2 cm of the Advanced Mucinous Colorectal Carcinoma in a Teenager: A Case Report of a Changing Age Paradigm East and Central African Journal of Surgery 10 Figure 1. Plain chest x-ray showing left sided pleural effusion (blue arrow) sigmoid, upper, mid, and distal rectum measuring 16 cm in length, suggestive of a rectosigmoid tumor. The tumor was causing large bowel obstruction with ascites, and left sided pleural effusion (Figure 2). Management He was transfused with one unit of whole blood (450 mL), and a left-sided thoracostomy tube was placed to drain the pleural effusion. He was then taken for an emergency colostomy to relieve the obstruction. The abdomen was opened through a upper midline incision. Intraoperatively, approximately 2 liters of hemorrhagic ascites were found. A hard, irregular pelvic mass, white in color, was identified, extending from the rectum to the anal canal and causing ob\u00ad struction of the colon. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were noted on the bowel mesentery, extending to its root, as well as in the paraaortic and celiac regions. Peritoneal metasta\u00ad sis was observed on the mesentery, omentum, liver, stom\u00ad ach, and anterior abdominal wall, consistent with Stage IV disease (cT4NxM1). A double-barrel mid-transverse colostomy was created, and a biopsy was taken. Histopathology revealed an infiltrative tumor composed of atypical glandular structures, with strips of tumor cells floating in large extracellular mucin lakes consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma with omental metastasis, pT4NxM1 (Figure 3). Outcome and follow-up His post-operative recovery was not promising, was man\u00ad aged in the surgical ICU with intravenous fluids, antibi\u00ad otics, analgesia and 450 mL of whole blood transfusion as per local protocol, and unfortunately, he succumbed nine Figure 2.

The largest dilatation measures 9.2 cm in size with a transition zone at the sigmoid colon. There is an associated pneumoperitoneum suggestive of large bowel obstruction with perforation due to rectosigmoid tumor. Ascites and left sided pleural effusion with collapse of left lower lobe are also observed (blue arrows). Figure 3.

Advanced Mucinous Colorectal Carcinoma in a Teenager: A Case Report of a Changing Age Paradigm East and Central African Journal of Surgery 11 DISCUSSION The delay in diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) in young patients, as demonstrated in the index case, is concerning in terms of improving prognosis.5 The absence of clear clin\u00ad ical features commonly associated with this malignancy is a significant factor contributing to poor outcomes. Conse\u00ad quently, there is a need for CRC screening in children and young adults, especially those with a family history of the disease.6 Furthermore, clinicians should ensure that all pa\u00ad tients, including children and young adults showing any signs or symptoms of CRC, are thoroughly evaluated and closely followed to detect and treat the disease at its early stages. CRC incidence is increasing globally among the younger generation, with a high fatality rate, however, it\u2019s largely preventable. Screening can reduce mortality rates, especially among young people, aged under 50 years. Im\u00ad plementing proven screening measures and developing in\u00ad novative risk assessment methods can help reduce CRC risk, especially in developing countries.1 In recent decades, there has been a steady decline in CRC incidence among the older population, which contrasts sharply with the rising incidence in young adults. CRC is increasingly recognized as an indicator of epidemiological change and socioeco\u00ad nomic shifts. The incidence and mortality rates of CRC are rising in low- and middle-income countries, in stark con\u00ad trast to the trends observed in developed nations. For ex\u00ad ample, data from the Kampala Cancer Registry highlight a dramatic increase in CRC rates. Specifically, in Tanzania, there has been a six-fold rise in the incidence of CRC.12 The authors found that patients presented at late stage of CRC, secondly there were younger patients diagnosed with CRC and thirdly there was a low rate of diagnostic colonoscopy on CRC patients. This not only shows a shift in the presentation of age but also a shift towards rise in non-communicable diseases in developing regions.12 Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has now be\u00ad come the second most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in younger populations. Sim\u00ad ilar upward trends are seen in Europe and North America, with a notable rise in distal colon and rectal cancers. A de\u00ad tailed analysis from 20 European countries revealed an an\u00ad nual increase in CRC incidence by 7.9% in individuals aged 20\u201329 years, 4.9% among those aged 30\u201339, and 1.6% in the 40\u201349 age group from 2004 to 2016. This data under\u00ad scores the urgency of addressing the rising burden of CRC in younger populations.13 Early-onset CRC is a highly heterogeneous disease, with hereditary genetic syndromes accounting for only a small proportion of cases, while the majority are classified as spo\u00ad radic.14 Mortality rates are higher in younger CRC patients compared to their elderly counterparts. This trend may be explained by two key factors: earlier exposure to known risk factors in the younger generation compared to previous ones, and the fact that neoplasms appearing at a younger age are often biologically more aggressive.15 In addition to well-known risk factors such as inflam\u00ad matory bowel disease and hereditary syndromes linked to CRC, other factors may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer. Lifestyle changes, including increased alcohol consumption, a sedentary lifestyle, high red meat intake, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, may par\u00ad tially explain this trend. However, current epidemiologic data are insufficient to establish a definitive correlation be\u00ad tween these factors and early-onset CRC.16 Various screening tests are available for CRC, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, and the quality of evidence supporting these tests varies. Common methods include guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs), fe\u00ad cal immunochemical tests (FITs), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy, among others.17,18 While these screening methods are valuable, they have limitations, and many el\u00ad igible individuals remain unscreened. Although novel screening techniques may help in early CRC detection and risk factor modification, significant benefits can still be achieved by optimizing existing screening methods. Chalya et al. highlight that CRC is rising in sub-Saharan Africa, at\u00ad tributed to urbanization and lifestyle changes. In contrast, CRC incidence is declining in developed countries due to improved outcomes from early detection, widespread screening of high-risk populations, and advancements in di\u00ad agnostic tools and treatment options.19 The authors note that CRC in African populations often present at a younger age and at a more advanced stage, leading to poorer prog\u00ad nosis, as illustrated by our case. CRC in younger patients is often associated with inher\u00ad ited syndromes such as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), inflammatory bowel disease, fa\u00ad milial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and MUTYH polypo\u00ad sis.20 This highlights age as an important factor for identi\u00ad fying familial and genetic predispositions.18 Due to limited resources, we were unable to conduct genetic screening on our patient, and genetic predisposition could not be as\u00ad sessed. Several family history criteria can suggest Lynch syndrome, notably the Amsterdam II Criteria and Revised Bethesda Guidelines. These guidelines are helpful in iden\u00ad tifying families likely to have Lynch syndrome. These include: (i) multiple family members with col\u00ad orectal cancer, particularly if diagnosed under age 50. (ii) presence of other Lynch syndrome-associated cancers in the family, such as endometrial, ovarian, or gastric cancer. (ii) cancers occurring across multiple generations. (iii) syn\u00ad chronous or metachronous colorectal cancers in one in\u00ad dividual.11 However, the morphological features observed in our case\u2014such as infiltrating lymphocytes, peritumoral lymphocytes, the absence of dirty necrosis, and mucinous features\u2014strongly suggest a microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) etiology, likely linked to LS. We recommend clin\u00ad icians perform genetic testing on young CRC patients whenever feasible. Colonoscopy would have been valuable Advanced Mucinous Colorectal Carcinoma in a Teenager: A Case Report of a Changing Age Paradigm East and Central African Journal of Surgery 12 to rule out conditions like FAP and MUTYH polyposis, which typically present with multiple colonic polyps. How\u00ad ever, due to the patient\u2019s unstable condition, colonoscopy could not be performed. In the index case, the teenager was diagnosed with advanced colorectal mucinous adenocarci\u00ad noma, aligning with findings by O. K. Ibrahim et al., who reported that colorectal cancers in younger populations are frequently either mucin-secreting or signet-ring cell carci\u00ad nomas. They present at advanced stages, and are associated with a poor prognosis, and this is due to the marked delay in diagnosis.21 A similar case presented by Akpa et al. of mu\u00ad cinous colon cancer in a 11-year-old female, and they state that these CRC in younger generation is poorly differenti\u00ad ated hence more aggressive and less chemo-sensitive, sug\u00ad gestive there may be differences in the biological pathogen\u00ad esis of these tumors compared to that of adults.4 There are various advances in immunotherapy, however, its implications to CRC patients remains uncertain as there are various on-going studies. Current immunotherapy ap\u00ad proaches for CRC including cancer vaccines such as autol\u00ad ogous vaccine, peptide vaccine, viral vector and dendritic cell (DC). Other immunologic therapies in trials are on\u00ad colytic virus therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy and immune modulators such as IDO1-inhibitors and anti- OX40 agonist therapy.22 Conventional cancer treatment strategies widely used to\u00ad day include surgical tumor resection, often followed by radiotherapy with x-rays and/or chemotherapy. Surgery is most effective during the early stages of disease progres\u00ad sion. However, radiation and chemotherapy pose risks, such as damage to healthy tissues and growing cells. Addition\u00ad ally, drug resistance remains a significant challenge in chemotherapy treatments. Targeted drug therapy offers a solution by specifically attacking cancer cells while min\u00ad imizing damage to normal, healthy cells. This approach exploits the unique programming that distinguishes cancer cells from healthy ones. Widely used targeted agents in\u00ad clude monoclonal antibodies and small molecule in\u00ad hibitors.23 A limitation of our case study is that we were unable to confirm a diagnosis of LS due to the unavailability of germline mutation testing in our setting. Similarly, although immunohistochemical testing for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) is a reliable method for diagnosing Lynch syndrome, this was also not feasible due to the patient\u2019s financial constraints. Our case study, along with similar reports of early-onset CRC, high\u00ad lights the need for improved CRC screening and the devel\u00ad opment of genetic counseling services to help prevent ad\u00ad vanced CRC in at-risk family members. CONCLUSION Colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients under 40 years of age is relatively rare, with mucinous adenocarcinoma represent\u00ad ing a particularly uncommon and aggressive subtype. This demographic often experiences challenges such as late pre\u00ad sentation, delayed diagnosis, and a lack of definitive clin\u00ad ical symptoms, which frequently lead to poorer outcomes. To mitigate these issues, early and proactive screening is essential, especially for individuals with a family history of CRC. Physicians must maintain a high level of vigilance and conduct comprehensive evaluations for young patients exhibiting colorectal symptoms. By prioritizing early detec\u00ad tion and timely treatment, healthcare providers can signifi\u00ad cantly improve prognosis and patient outcomes. CRC and its management pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in resource-limited countries like Tanzania. The late presentation of CRC and the ab\u00ad sence of adequate screening programs contribute to high morbidity and mortality rates in these developing regions. To address these issues, stakeholders should focus on im\u00ad proving population education, training clinicians at the pri\u00ad mary health level, implementing screening programs for high-risk individuals, and introducing cost-effective treat\u00ad ment options. Additionally, enhancing follow-up tech\u00ad niques is crucial for better management and outcomes in CRC patients.

In low-resource settings like Uganda, managing these conditions is especially difficult due to limited access to multidisciplinary specialized care. The shortage of Craniofacial Surgeons and inadequately equipped healthcare facilities further complicate the delivery of proper treatment. This study presents three cases of children with craniofacial anomalies attended at Kiruddu Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda, highlighting the significant gaps in care and the pressing need for enhanced medical resources in East Africa. Background Craniofacial Anomalies (CFAs) are among the most com\u00ad mon human birth defects and have considerable functional, aesthetic, and social consequences.1,2 Each year, approxi\u00ad mately 295,000 infants succumb to congenital anomalies, with the majority of these anomalies involving a diverse ar\u00ad ray of structural and functional abnormalities of the head and facial areas.2\u20115 Clefts of the palate and lips are com\u00ad monly reported form associated with CFA occurring in 1 out of every 700 live births.4 In low-resource countries like Uganda, there is a signifi\u00ad cant dearth of information regarding the presentation, man\u00ad agement, and outcomes of children with CFAs. Compound\u00ad ing this issue is the lack of accessible Craniofacial Surgeons and adequately equipped Craniofacial units, which hinders the provision of appropriate care and support for these chil\u00ad dren.6\u20118 Moreover, studies have indicated that children with craniofacial anomalies are often stigmatized, with some as\u00ad sociating their condition with superstitions such as divine punishment or witchcraft.9\u201111 We report therefore, three cases of children born with CFA at Kiruddu National Referral Hospital. We aim to cre\u00ad ate awareness to the public about presentation and manage\u00ad ment challenges of children with CFA but also to inform policy makers to set priorities tailored in supporting chil\u00ad dren with this condition in low resources countries includ\u00ad ing Uganda. Case 1 The case involves a 3-week-old female baby who was de\u00ad livered at term with several craniofacial anomalies.

Has a right lateral nasal tag, macrosomia, web neck, micrognathia, hypertelorism, and strabismus. While the right ear appears normal, the left ear exhibits complete hypoplasia (microtia). in the left 1/3 of the lower lip, and a complete defect of the palate with a tag on the right nasal side wall. Additionally, there were wide-set eyes, a small mandible, absence of the left external ear, and a normal canal. The child experienced difficulty in suckling and breathing when breast milk was given. The parents had limited education and occasional al\u00ad cohol intake but no reported family history of CFA or other congenital malformation. The child was diagnosed with Goldenhar syndrome, a syndromic craniofacial anomaly, along with a differential diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome with facial clefts, bilateral complete cleft lip and palate, and nasal pyriform aperture stenosis. Due to financial constraints and limited diagnostic tech\u00ad niques, sophisticated investigations have not been per\u00ad formed. The planned treatment involves orthodontist inter\u00ad vention, lip repair at the age of 3 months, cleft and Tessier repair at 9-12 months, and left ear reconstruction between the ages of 6 and 10 years, although the child has not yet reached the appropriate age for these specific operations. Figure1 Case 2 The case involves a one-month-old male child who was born with multiple deformities affecting the head, fingers, and toes. The baby was delivered via Caesarian section post-term, weighed 3.7kg, and required oxygen support for four hours after delivery. The child is the fifth born to a 26-year-old mother and 34-year-old father. The mother received prenatal care, including iron and folic acid sup\u00ad Figure 2 A & B.

There is no history of a CFA or other congenital malforma\u00ad tion in the family, and the other four siblings are healthy. The baby breastfeeds well, and was brought to the hospital for the repair of hand and feet deformities. Physical examination revealed a high peaked frontal head, midface hypoplasia, exophthalmos, spoon and mitten fingers and toes (bilateral), a high notched palate, and me\u00ad dial bending of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb finger bilaterally. The diagnosis of Apert syndrome, characterized by mitten or spoon fingers, a high peaked forehead, a high arch, and hypertelorism was made. (Figure 2) Case 3 The case involves a 6-month-old male child who presented with an abnormal head shape since birth, accompanied by abnormal limb movements, finger fixed in a flexed po\u00ad sition, hearing impairment, delayed milestones, and poor weight gain. The child is the third born and was delivered by Caesarean section at term, with delayed crying and the need for resuscitation. The mother received prenatal care starting at 12 weeks gestational age and made six visits, re\u00ad ceiving folic acid, Tetanus toxoid, and unidentified malaria treatment. There is a family history of similar abnormalities in the paternal grandmother and great grandfather, with fin\u00ad gers fixed in flexed positions. The child\u2019s parents are refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with no history of alcohol or sub\u00ad stance use. The other two siblings are unaffected. The child was referred from Mulago neurosurgical center with a diag\u00ad nosis of coronal craniosynostosis and was planned for mul\u00ad tidiscipline team approach lead by Plastic and Reconstruc\u00ad tive surgeons.

Computed tomography scans confirmed metopic, coronal, and sagittal fusion, leading to leading to a diagnosis of metopic craniosynostosis (Carpen\u00ad ter syndrome). The child did not undergo surgical correc\u00ad tion due to the unavailability of a craniofacial surgeon and craniofacial unit, and there was no screening for syndromic causes due to limited molecular diagnostic techniques in the local setting. (figure 3) Discussion We present three cases of children with craniofacial anom\u00ad alies (CFA) who were treated at Kiruddu National Referral Hospital. The first case involves a child with Goldenhar syndrome, the second case The first case involves a child with Goldenhar syndrome, the second case is a child with Apert syndrome, and the third case is a child with metopic Craniosynostosis (Carpenter syndrome). The standard ap\u00ad proach to describing CFA includes both physical and clin\u00ad ical observations. However, the comprehensive evaluation of these patients requires sophisticated investigations such as CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Unfortunately, these investiga\u00ad tions were not initially conducted due to financial con\u00ad straints and the lack of genetic typing service in our setting. Among the reported cases, only the one with metopic Craniosynostosis (Carpenter syndrome) had a reported fam\u00ad ily history. This is consistent with the most studies on cran\u00ad iofacial anomalies (CFA) that occur sporadically, possibly due to new mutations.5,12 As observed in our case series, craniofacial anomalies (CFA) typically manifest with a combination of deformities affecting the extremities, neck, heart, and abdomen, in line with previous research find\u00ad ings.13 None of the three cases showed any evident risk factors for CFAs, highlighting the need for further inves\u00ad tigation into the etiology and pathogenesis of congenital craniofacial anomalies in our setting. Unfortunately, the lack of advanced molecular diagnostic techniques hampers our ability to identify and understand many craniofacial dis\u00ad orders, leaving them unknown.1 Nevertheless, majority of the congenital body defects still have no known causes es\u00ad tablished, most cases do occur sporadically, influenced by genetic and environmental factors such as smoking, alco\u00ad hol use , pre and post conception folic acid use, among others.14\u201116 Effective management of children with cranio\u00ad facial anomalies (CFA) necessitates a comprehensive, coor\u00ad dinated, and culturally sensitive approach to care. However, our case series and similar studies have revealed a signif\u00ad icant lack of easily accessible specialized and coordinated care to address the unique challenges faced by these chil\u00ad dren, particularly in low-resource countries.17 Although no obvious risk factors were identified in any of the three cases, the lack of improved molecular diagnos\u00ad tic techniques in our setting hampers our ability to further understand the causes and mechanisms underlying congen\u00ad ital craniofacial anomalies. As a result, many craniofacial disorders remain unknown and require further investigation for a comprehensive understanding of their etiology and pathogenesis. Presentation and Challenges Associated with Management Of Children with Craniofacial Anomalies at Kir\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 18 Conclusion This case series provided valuable insights into the three cases of craniofacial anomalies, but it is important to note that the follow-up for these cases was limited. As a result, the specific details regarding the long-term management and outcomes of these individuals remain unclear. While the initial diagnoses and treatment plans were established, the comprehensive assessment of their progress and the ef\u00ad fectiveness of the interventions were not fully documented. Further research and more extensive follow-up studies are necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the management and outcomes for individuals with craniofacial anomalies in resource constraints settings. Establishing a safe and effective service for craniofacial anomalies in a national referral hospital requires assembling a multidis\u00ad ciplinary team, creating dedicated facilities, and providing continuous training for healthcare professionals. This train\u00ad ing can be facilitated through national and international ex\u00ad change programs, including workshops and on-site visits by experts from high-income countries.

The Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Zambia is home to FlySpec, a medical charity that facilitates surgical care delivery to the most remote Zambian communities. We studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the FlySpec program. Methods: We analyzed yearly FlySpec reports from 2018 to 2022 to identify differences in various surgical care delivery metrics. Results: We found that there was a reduction in the number of hospital visits, patients seen, and operations performed Post-COVID-19 compared to Pre-COVID-19. There was no difference in the number of FlySpec car visits or air visits in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the clinical activity of FlySPec. Introduction Orthopedic injuries and musculoskeletal trauma are major contributors to the global burden of disease.1,2 While or\u00ad thopedic surgery is a vital component of healthcare in de\u00ad veloped countries, many low-income countries struggle to provide adequate care for their populations due to limited resources, poor infrastructure, and a shortage of trained pro\u00ad fessionals.3,4 In low-income countries, musculoskeletal in\u00ad juries and conditions are often left untreated or are treated inadequately, leading to disability, chronic pain, and re\u00ad duced quality of life for patients.3,5 These countries also ex\u00ad perience a higher burden of orthopedic conditions due to factors such as poor road infrastructure, limited access to safe water and sanitation, and a high prevalence of infec\u00ad tious diseases. In Sub-Saharan African nations, healthcare resources are typically concentrated in dense, urban cities which makes it more challenging to provide surgical care to rural populations.6\u20118 Addressing the need for orthopedic surgery in low-in\u00ad come countries requires a concerted effort from govern\u00ad ments, healthcare professionals, and the global health com\u00ad munity. Outreach programs and mission trips are important tools that can mobilize medical experts to provide higher levels of care in rural communities. The Department of Or\u00ad thopedic Surgery at the University of Zambia is home to FlySpec, a medical charity that facilitates surgical care de\u00ad livery to the most remote and rural Zambian communities.9 Established in 1982, FlySpec operates with a team of ortho\u00ad pedic surgeons, prosthetists, physiotherapists, and one plas\u00ad tic surgeon. The organization travels via road and air trans\u00ad port to reach rural hospitals where the patient population lacks access to consistent surgical care.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the delivery of healthcare services, including orthopedic surgery, which has resulted in delay of care.10\u201112 The exact impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the FlySpec program has not been studied. Conducting a study to examine the current state of the program and how it has operated over the past few years will provide valuable insight into its ca\u00ad pacity and future potential. Methods This retrospective chart review study involving human par\u00ad ticipants was in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The National Health Re\u00ad search Authority (NHRA) of Zambia approved this study. We conducted a retrospective study examining FlySpec trip reports from 2018-2022. The sites included in the trip reports span across 7 provinces in Zambia. These were Mukinge Mission Hospital, Chitokoloki Mission Hospital, and Kalene Hills Hospital in the Northwestern Province. The sites in the Northern Province included Chilonga Mis\u00ad sion Hospital, Kasama Teaching Hospital, and Mbala Gen\u00ad eral Hospital. The Eastern Province site was St. Francis Mission Hospital and the Western Province site was Lewanika General Hospital. Macha General Hospital, Maz\u00ad abuka General Hospital, and Livingstone Teaching Hospi\u00ad tal comprised the Southern Province sites. Kabwe General Hospital in the Central Province and Mansa General Hospi\u00ad tal in Luapula Province were also included. All trip reports were collected by one individual. The trip reports include valuable information regarding the logistics of clinical care. Pertinent metrics include the number of hospital visits, both by air and by car. Addi\u00ad tionally, the operative case volume and quantity of patients seen were scrutinized. These metrics were recorded using the same software across all hospital visits. The reports in\u00ad cluded other metrics, such as \u201cmajor operations\u201d, \u201cminor operations\u201d, and \u201cimplants used\u201d. However, these were not consistently disclosed in trip reports and showed a degree of provider variability. Therefore, these metrics were left out of the retrospective analysis and omitted from comparison. Mean values and standard deviations were used to analyze differences in the data. Statistical Analysis First, the data was classified into two groups. The first group was defined as Pre-COVID-19 and included data from the years 2018-2019. The second group was defined as Post-COVID-19 and included data from the years 2020-2022. Next, the mean value of each metric in both groups was calculated. Following this, the standard devia\u00ad tion for each metric in the Post-COVID-19 group was cal\u00ad culated. The null hypothesis is that COVID-19 has no effect on FlySpec hospital visits. Results Annual report data can be found in Table 1. The mean num\u00ad ber of hospital visits Pre-COVID-19 was 71.5 compared to a Post-COVID-19 mean of 57.6. This decrease is also reflected in the mean number of Pre-COVID-19 air vis\u00ad its, which was 45, compared to a Post-COVID-19 mean of 30.6. On the contrary, the mean number of car visits increased after 2020, with a Post-COVID-19 mean of 27 compared to a Pre-COVID-19 mean of 26.5. These differ\u00ad ences highlight the changes in FlySpec practice following COVID-19. Similarly, the mean number of patients seen and number of operations performed decreased in Post-COVID-19 com\u00ad pared to Pre-COVID-19 (Figure 1). The standard deviation (std dev) for the Post-COVID-19 metrics was also calcu\u00ad lated (Table 2). Finally, the mean value difference between Pre-COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 metrics was calculated to compare average changes. This comparison is shown in Table 3. Discussion Our results highlight a difference in the number of hospital visits, patients seen, and operations performed between Pre- COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 values. On the other hand, a smaller difference was observed in both the number of air visits and car visits throughout COVID-19. This is likely Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Zambia\u2019s FlySpec Program in Delivering Specialized Surgical Ca\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 22 because the determining factor between a car visit or an air visit taking place is the distance of the rural hospital from Lusaka, Zambia. The COVID-19 pandemic had no effect on this distance. Therefore, despite its effects on resource mobilization and healthcare personnel, COVID-19 failed to have a large impact on affecting FlySpec\u2019s mode of trans\u00ad portation to a rural hospital. The reduction in FlySpec\u2019s clinical activity after 2020 is consistent with published findings that COVID-19 has dis\u00ad rupted clinical services globally.13,14 Elective surgeries and international humanitarian efforts were severely impacted by the pandemic, and FlySpec\u2019s efforts were similarly at\u00ad tenuated.15,16 Patients residing in remote Zambian com\u00ad munities are most likely to be affected by this decrease in FlySpec\u2019s activity. This has likely resulted in further pro\u00ad gression of their pathologies resultinging in more urgent clinical presentations. As FlySpec\u2019s clinical activity reaches pre-COVID-19 levels, there may be a correspond\u00ad ing shift in patient morbidity as a result of this delayed pre\u00ad sentation. Future studies are needed to accurately assess this discrepancy and to expand on this study\u2019s findings. For in\u00ad stance, analyzing intraoperative data will result in a better assessment of FlySpec\u2019s surgical capacity. Limitations This study has several limitations. The FlySpec trip data is reported as annual aggregates as opposed to individual trip details. This is because FlySpec aggregates numerous trip reports and reports them in annual newsletters as op\u00ad posed to individual trip reports. Efforts to obtain individual trip reports were not successful. This data aggregation has Figure 1. Mean data of FlySpec reports Pre-COVID-19 vs Post-COVD-19 Table 2. Standard deviation of post-COVID-19 FlySpec data #Hospital visits 3.3 #Air visits 9.42 #Car visits 6.48 #Patients seen 569 #Operations performed 115.1 Table 3. Difference between Post-COVID-19 and Pre- COVID-19 Mean Values Metric Value difference (std dev) Hospital visits 4.21 Air visits 1.53 Car visits 0.08 Patients seen 2.41 Operations performed 2.75 the consequence of heavily reducing the sample size for a given metric. Notwithstanding this, valuable points can be learned from this article regarding the detrimental impact of COVID-19 on FlySpec\u2019s outreach efforts. Conclusion FlySpec, a medical charity based in Zambia, has developed partnerships with rural hospitals over the past several decades. The organization has been heavily impacted by the Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Zambia\u2019s FlySpec Program in Delivering Specialized Surgical Ca\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 23 COVID-19 pandemic. There was a decrease in the number of patients seen, hospitals visited, and operations performed Post-COVID-19 compared to Pre-COVID-19. More work needs to be done to further assess the impact of the program in rural communities and to better characterize the chal\u00ad lenges faced by the beneficiaries.

In Malawi, osteosarcoma accounts for 2.2% of all registered bone tumors. However, little is known about the patterns of diagnosis and treatment of this disease in this setting. Delays in diagnosis and treatment may contribute to poor outcomes and survival. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the clinical features, diagnostic methods, and treatment modalities associated with osteosarcoma in Malawi. The study also investigated timelines between symptom onset, healthcare consultation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. Method We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of 25 patients who were diagnosed with osteosarcoma at Queen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital, in Blantyre- Malawi, between January 2011 and December 2016. We extracted data on patient demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic procedures, incisional biopsy histological findings, treatment options, and time intervals from symptom onset to first presentation at a tertiary hospital, and from diagnosis to treatment initiation. We obtained approval, to conduct study, from the College of Medicine Research and Ethics Center (COMREC) (P.02/18/2364). Results Out of 11,165 malignancies registered during the study period, 25 (0.22%) were osteosarcoma cases. The median age of the patients was 25.04 years (SD +/-11) with an equal sex distribution. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (100%) and swelling (92%). The median duration from symptom onset to first visit at tertiary hospital being 8.5 months and time of diagnosis to treatment with a median duration of 16.5 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by histology in 14 (56%) cases and by radiography in 11 (44%) cases. No tumor grade was recorded in the histology reports. The treatment carried out included amputation (48%), palliative care (symptom supportive care) (32%), limb salvage surgery (4%), and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (4%). Three patients (12%) refused amputation. No patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusion Osteosarcoma is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat in Malawi due to its rarity, nonspecific symptoms, lack of histological grading and staging, limited treatment options, and long delays in the care pathway. There is a need for increased awareness and suspicion among primary health care providers, improved access to diagnostic facilities and specialized care, and multidisciplinary collaboration to optimize the management and prognosis of osteosarcoma patients in this setting. Background Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumour that originates from primitive bone-forming mesenchymal cells.1 It is the most common primary bone cancer in children, adoles\u00ad cents, and young adults, with a peak incidence in the second decade of life.1,2 It has a male predominance and usually affects the metaphyseal regions of long bones, especially This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(3):25-32. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i3.6 around the knee.1,3 The etiology of osteosarcoma is un\u00ad clear, but some risk factors include previous irradiation, Paget\u2019s disease, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, benign bone tumors, and genetic syndromes such as hereditary retinoblastoma and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.1,4\u20116 Osteosarcoma patients typically present with localized pain and swelling that may be related to strain, trauma, or infection.2,3 The pain may be nocturnal or persistent and may interfere with joint movement.4 Radiological features of osteosarcoma include increased intramedullary sclero\u00ad sis with permeative destruction, elevation of periosteum re\u00ad sulting in Codman\u2019s triangle or sunburst appearance, and new bone formation in soft tissues.4,7,8 Osteosarcoma can be classified into different subtypes based on the location within the bone (central, parosteal, periosteal), the degree of differentiation (conventional, telangiectatic), and the his\u00ad tological variation (osteoblastic, chondroblastic, fibroblas\u00ad tic).9\u201111 Osteosarcoma has an incidence rate of 4 to 5 per million persons per year in children and adolescents.11,12 However, this rare disease is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late, especially in low-resource settings. In sub-Saharan Africa, osteosarcoma poses a significant challenge for the health system, as it requires specialized care and multidisciplinary management.11,12 The epidemiology of osteosarcoma in this region is poorly understood, as there is a lack of reliable data from population-based cancer registries. According to the Global Burden of Disease report, os\u00ad teosarcoma was responsible for 0.1% of all cancer deaths and 0.2% of all cancer disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019.13 However, these estimates may not reflect the true burden of the disease, as they are based on modelling and extrapolation from other regions. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more re\u00ad search and investment in data production, analysis, and in\u00ad terpretation to inform national cancer policies and programs in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the factors that contributes to the poor outcomes of osteosarcoma patients in sub-Saharan Africa is the late presentation of the disease.14,15 Muthupei and Mariba re\u00ad ported a 5-year survival rate of 7.5% in their 2000 study of 66 osteosarcoma patients at a tertiary hospital in South Africa (SA), which is comparable to outcomes from the 1950s in developed countries.14 In 2010, Shipley and Beukes reported on 30 patients with osteosarcoma treated at another SA tertiary institution.16 Half of their patients presented with metastases.5,16 The majority of patients in these studies from developing countries presented with ad\u00ad vanced disease, to which the authors attributed their poor outcomes compared with the far better survival rates in de\u00ad veloped countries .5,16 Marko et al observed that patients in countries with medium/low Human Development Index had longer delays and higher prevalence of metastasis at di\u00ad agnosis compared to those in countries with very high/high Human Development Index.17 Noor et al. had similar find\u00ad ings in a study in Cambodia, with a 5-year survival rate of only 8%, citing late presentation and cultural preferences as the main factors responsible for the poor outcomes.5,18 In summary, the factors contributing to diagnostic delay may be related to the patient (lack of knowledge around bone tumours, limited finances to travel to a health care facil\u00ad ity,lack of finances to pay for diagnostic tests), the provider (limited diagnostic capacity, unavailability of in house spe\u00ad cialists), or the country (no well-established referral sys\u00ad tems, failure to supply stocks or service diagnostic tools e.g. magnetic resonance imaging).5,19 These studies highlight the need for early detection and referral of osteosarcoma cases, as well as improved access to quality care and supportive services for patients and their families. The treatment of osteosarcoma has improved signifi\u00ad cantly in the last 25 years, especially for patients with local\u00ad ized disease.1,2,7,14 This is attributed to the advancement in multimodal therapy that combines surgery and chemother\u00ad apy.3,5,15,20 Several randomized trials have shown that the combination of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with surgery significantly improves the cure rates and re\u00ad duces the local and distant relapse rates.21 The surgical op\u00ad tions include limb salvage or amputation depending on the tumor location, size, extent, and response to chemother\u00ad apy.7 The goal of surgery is to achieve adequate local con\u00ad trol and preserve function.7 Therefore, this study aimed to describe the clinical fea\u00ad tures, diagnostic methods, and treatment modalities asso\u00ad ciated with osteosarcoma in Malawi. The study also in\u00ad vestigated timelines between symptom onset, healthcare consultation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address this topic in this setting. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of 25 patients who were diagnosed with osteosarcoma at Queen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital between January 2011 and December 2016. Queen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital is the largest referral center for oncology patients in Malawi. We obtained an approval to carry out the study from the College of Medicine Research and Ethics Center (COM\u00ad REC) (P.02/18/2364. Formal request was written to head of department in Oncology Unit, Surgery Department and hos\u00ad pital director to have access to patients\u2019 charts. No informed consent was obtained from the patients since the study did not involve intervention on patients or contacting the pa\u00ad tients. We included all inpatients who had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma during this period based on histological or ra\u00ad diological criteria. We excluded patients who had insuffi\u00ad cient data or whose diagnosis changed to another malig\u00ad Osteosarcoma diagnosis and treatment at a tertiary hospital in Blantyre, Malawi: A retrospective, descripti\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 26 Chart 1. Paper screening and inclusion nancy after review of histology. Refer to chart 1 delineating inclusion criteria. We collected data on patient demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic procedures, histological findings, treatment options, and time intervals from symptom onset to treatment initiation using a data collection sheet. We defined symptom onset as the date when the patient first noticed any symptom related to osteosarcoma; presen\u00ad tation as the date when the patient first visited low level health care system and from low level care to first visit at tertiary hospital; diagnosis as the date when histological or radiological confirmation was obtained; treatment as the date when any therapeutic intervention was started; patient delay as the time interval from symptom onset to presen\u00ad tation; professional delay as the time interval from presen\u00ad tation to diagnosis; system delay as the time interval from diagnosis to treatment; and total delay as the time interval from symptom onset to treatment. We used Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, Red\u00ad mond, WA) to build our database and generate tables and charts. We used IBM SPSS Version 1.0.0-1762 (1.0.0-1762) to perform descriptive statistics and frequency analysis. RESULTS The study examined the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treat\u00ad ment of osteosarcoma cases at Queen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital in Malawi. The main findings were: Osteosarcoma was a rare ma\u00ad lignancy, accounting for only 0.22% (n=25 out of 11,165) of all cancers registered during the study period.22 The pa\u00ad tients had a median age of 25.04 years (Standard Devia\u00ad tion (SD) =11), with an equal sex distribution (13 males and 12 females) and a wide age range (13-58 years). The most common symptoms were pain 100%(n=25) and swelling 92% (n=23) refer to figure 1, and the most common site was the knee refer to figure 4. The common site of osteosar\u00ad coma was around the knee 44% (n=11) refer to diagram 1. The diagnosis was confirmed by histology in 56%(n=14) of cases and by radiography in 44% (n=11) of cases. 76% (n=19) had incisional biopsy done but only 56%(n=14) re\u00ad ceived histology results. No tumor grade was recorded in any histology report. Except for 16%(n=4) cases that pre\u00ad sented with metastasis, which is stage 3 on Enneking clas\u00ad sification, the rest could not be assigned an Enneking stage. The median duration from symptom onset to presentation at the tertiary hospital was 8.5 months, indicating a long delay in seeking care. The mean time from diagnosis to treatment was 16.4 days. The treatment offered (figure 2 and 3) included amputation in 48% (n=12) of cases, symp\u00ad tomatic palliative care in 32%(n=8), limb salvage surgery for 4% (n=1) of the cases, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy only 4% (n=1). No patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. 12% (n=3) of our patients declined to have an amputation. The study did not report on the survival or outcome of the patients due to lack of digitized data for outpatient care or cancer registry that actively followed up patients in out\u00ad patient setting. This resulted in the loss of the information to determine survival or outcome of the chosen treatments.

Reasons that promted patients to seek medical care. Figure 2. Showing treatment patterns Figure 3. Graph showing surgeries done or offered DISCUSSION Osteosarcoma is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat in Malawi due to its rarity, nonspecific symptoms, lack of histological grading and staging, limited treatment options , and long delays in the care pathway . Our study provides some insights into these issues based on a retrospective review of medical records of 25 osteosarcoma patients at Queen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital. Our study population had a median age of 26 years , which is higher than the peak incidence age reported in other studies .1,3,4 This may reflect a different epidemiol\u00ad ogy of osteosarcoma in Malawi or a selection bias due to late presentation or referral. We also found an equal sex dis\u00ad tribution among our patients , whereas other studies have reported a male predominance .23\u201125 These findings suggest that there may be some demographic differences between osteosarcoma patients in Malawi and those in other settings, but sample size was small to make definitive conclusion. The most common presenting symptoms in our study were pain and swelling , which are consistent with previous reports .7,9,26,27 However ,the median duration of symptom onset to presentation at tertiary hospital for osteosarcoma patients in Malawi was 8.5 months, which is much longer than what has been reported elsewhere.2,8,23,26,28 For ex\u00ad ample, a study from Ethiopia reported a median duration of 3.5 months for bone sarcoma patients,8 while a study from Nigeria reported a mean duration of 36 months+/-4.1 months for osteosarcoma patients,27 Tanzania sarcoma study by Siwillis et al.28 had reported duration of 5 months. In contrast, studies from developed countries have reported much shorter durations, such as 1.2 months in the UK,21.3 months in the USA,23 and 1.5 months in Canada.26 These differences may reflect the variations in the availability and accessibility of health care services, the awareness and knowledge of osteosarcoma symptoms, and the socio-eco\u00ad nomic and cultural factors that influence health-seeking be\u00ad havior among osteosarcoma patients in different settings. Unfortunately, we could not obtain data on symptom on\u00ad set to first visit at any health center because it was not doc\u00ad umented in the files, which would have helped us to better understand this aspect. The confirmation of osteosarcoma diagnosis by histol\u00ad ogy in only 56% of the cases in Malawi is lower than the rates reported in other African countries, such as Ethiopia (86.4%), Tanzania (100%), and South Africa (100%).8,9,28 This suggests that there is a need to improve the availability and accessibility of biopsy services and histopathology lab\u00ad oratories in Malawi.The lack of tumor grade or staging in the Malawian study is also a major limitation, as these fac\u00ad tors are important for prognostication and treatment plan\u00ad ning. In contrast, other studies from Africa and elsewhere have reported the tumor grade and stage of osteosarcoma patients. The absence of standardized reporting or quality control for osteosarcoma diagnosis in Malawi may affect the accuracy and outcomes of these patients. The use of ra\u00ad diography as the sole diagnostic method in 44% (n=11) of the cases in our study is not recommended, as radiography alone cannot differentiate between benign and malignant bone lesions. Moreover, radiography cannot provide infor\u00ad mation on the histological subtype, and grade of osteosar\u00ad coma, which are essential for determining the appropriate treatment regimen. Therefore, radiography should be used Osteosarcoma diagnosis and treatment at a tertiary hospital in Blantyre, Malawi: A retrospective, descripti\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 28 as an adjunct to biopsy and histopathology, not as a substi\u00ad tute. The common site of osteosarcoma was around the knee 44% (n=11) refer to diagrammatic presentation. This is in keeping with studies done in other centres.1,2,28 The mean time from diagnosis to treatment was 16.4 days in our study , which is comparable to what has been reported in other low- and middle-income countries.15,19, 29However , we found that only 4% (n=1) of our patients re\u00ad ceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy , which is considered as an essential component of multimodal therapy for osteosar\u00ad coma .4,19,21This was likely be due to lack of resources , expertise , protocols , or compliance for administering chemotherapy in Malawi,during the period data was col\u00ad lected. Furthermore, we found that only 4% (n=1) of our pa\u00ad tients underwent limb salvage surgery, whereas 48%(n=12) underwent amputation. This may be due to lack of facilities, equipment, skills, or prosthesis for performing limb salvage surgery in Malawi. Limb salvage surgery has been shown to improve function and quality of life without compromis\u00ad ing survival compared to amputation.16,30 However, some patients may refuse limb salvage surgery due to fear of recurrence or preference for amputa\u00ad tion. We found that 12%(n=3) of our patients declined am\u00ad putation, which may be due to cultural or religious reasons, lack of social support, or poor understanding of the disease and its treatment. The comparison of survival rates between our study and other studies is difficult, as the QECH study did not report the follow-up duration or the number of deaths among the patients. However, based on the available data, it can be inferred that the survival rate of osteosarcoma patients in Figure 4. Diagram showing geographical distribution of Osteosarcoma Malawi is likely to be low, as 52% (n=13) of them pre\u00ad sented with advanced disease (16%(n=4) with metastasis to lung and liver and 36%(n=9) with unspecified advanced disease at diagnosis), which is associated with poor prog\u00ad nosis.16,28,31 In addition, most of them did not receive ad\u00ad equate treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery, due to various reasons, such as late referral, or refusal. These factors may also contribute to the low sur\u00ad vival rate of osteosarcoma patients in Malawi. In com\u00ad parison, other studies from Africa and elsewhere have re\u00ad ported higher survival rates for osteosarcoma patients who received multimodal treatment, such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy.16,19,30 Our study has some limitations that should be acknowl\u00ad edged. First, it was a retrospective study based on medical records that may have been incomplete or inaccurate. Sec\u00ad ond, it was conducted at a single tertiary hospital that may not be representative of the whole country. Third, it had a small sample size that may limit the generalizability. Fourth, it did not include data on survival or recurrence rates, which are important indicators of prognosis and qual\u00ad ity of care. Despite these limitations, our study provides some valu\u00ad able information on the clinical features, diagnostic meth\u00ad ods, treatment modalities, and time intervals of osteosar\u00ad coma patients in Malawi. It also highlights the challenges and gaps in the diagnosis and management of this disease in this setting. There is a need for increased awareness and suspicion among primary health care providers, im\u00ad proved access to diagnostic facilities and specialized care, and multidisciplinary collaboration to optimize the manage\u00ad ment and prognosis of osteosarcoma patients in Malawi.

Western guidelines recommend preop coronary studies before valve surgery for patients above 40 years of age and that has also been the practice in patients with rheumatic valve disease. Co-existence of coronary disease among patients with rheumatic valve disease is not well studied before. Objective To evaluate the prevalence of Coronary artery disease among older adults (above 40 years of age) undergoing valve procedures due to rheumatic heart disease and asses the validity of age-based recommendation for preop screening among those patients. Method Retrospective chart review of patients with rheumatic valve disease who underwent valve surgeries between January 2017 to October 2023 at Tenwek Hospital,Kenya was done. All patients 40 years of age and above were included, patients with non rheumatic valvular diseases, patients with confirmed or symptomatic Coronary artery disease were excluded. Results A total of 108 patients were identified. Seventy-five (69%) patients were female, median age was 51 yrs and mitral valve replacement was the most common procedure. Ninety-eight percent had preop coronary screening study and only 2 cases of mild disease detected with the rest of them having no evidence of coronary disease. Conclusions This study showed that coronary artery disease is infrequent among patients with rheumatic valve disease and screening can possibly be considered only for patients with strong risk factors rather than age alone. Further study on the topic is recommended to establish strong practice guideline for this particular patient population. Introduction Chronic rheumatic valvular heart disease is the leading cause of cardiovascular death in developing countries. In 2015, it was estimated to affect more than 30 million pop\u00ad ulation in those countries, and it is the main indication of open-heart surgical procedures.1,2 In contrast, coronary artery disease is the main cardiovascular pathology and in\u00ad dication for cardiac surgical operations in developed na\u00ad tions. The valvular diseases in those countries are mainly related to age-related degenerative processes and they tend to have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) justify\u00ad This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

The practice and results of age-based coronary study among patients 40 years and above undergoing valve surgery due to rheumatic heart disease: A cross-sectional study. East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(3):33-37. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i3.7 ing the recommendation for routine screening among those patients preoperatively. Some centers reported that the ma\u00ad jority of patients who had aortic or mitral valve surgery needed concomitant coronary procedures due to significant coronary obstruction.3 Among patients presenting with symptomatic aortic stenosis, concurrent CAD occurs in over 50 % of those over 70 years of age and over 65 % of those over 80 years of age.4Contrary to that, due to the difference in the pathophysiology of rheumatic valvular heart disease and socioeconomic factors, CAD is rare among the patient population. But because of the lack of strong study on this issue, we have been following the AHA recommenda\u00ad tion of screening all patients above 40 years of age with Chronic rheumatic valvular heart disease (CRVHD) requir\u00ad ing surgery for incidental CAD preoperatively, although the guideline recommends even lower age at 35 years for screening cutoff age if patients have strong risk factors.5 For this reason, we decided to evaluate the results of coro\u00ad nary studies among those patients who had surgery at our hospital from January 2017 to October 2023. Methods Study design This is a retrospective study done by reviewing the patients\u2019 admission and operative charts looking for the reports of coronary studies, the valve(s) affected, and procedures per\u00ad formed from January 2017 to October 2023 at Tenwek Hos\u00ad pital, a training mission hospital performing the majority of open-heart surgery in Kenya and East African region. Ethics approval was obtained from the hospital\u2019s institu\u00ad tional ethics and research committee. Inclusion criteria-Patients aged 40 years and above, with rheumatic valve disease. Exclusion criteria: Age less than 40, all other causes of valvular diseases, including aortic aneurysm, degenera\u00ad tive disease, and symptomatic IHD patients with concomi\u00ad tant valve disease. Data collection and analysis The operative database was first screened and identified all patients who are 40 years of age or above and had open heart surgery due to CRVHD only, all other indications are excluded. The age at the time of surgery, gender, Body mass index (BMI), and comorbid diseases like Hyperten\u00ad sion (HTN) and Diabetes mellitus (DM) were recorded. The valve lesions and the specific procedure (repair vs replace\u00ad ment) were documented. The coronary study results were checked and grouped as normal and abnormal. Basic de\u00ad scriptive statistics were done using PSPP and tables and graphs were generated using MS Excel. Results Our study captured 108 patients who met the inclusion cri\u00ad teria during the study period. The majority (n=75) were fe\u00ad male and the mean age at surgery was 51yrs as indicated in Table 1. Isolated Mitral valve replacement was the most per\u00ad formed single valve operation (n=37) followed by Mitral replacement with Tricuspid ring annuloplasty(n=22). Com\u00ad bined Double or triple valve procedure accounts for almost half of the procedures(n=50) as shown in Figure 1. Ninety-eight percent of patients had coronary studies ei\u00ad ther with CT coronary angiography (CTCA) or invasive coronary angiogram and results were reported for degree of calcification with calcium score and/or degree of stenosis of major coronary arteries. Only two patients had mild non- obstructing CAD identified and required no additional in\u00ad tervention (figure 2). The first patient was a female, 49 years old with hypercholesterolemia found in laboratory studies. The second patient was also female, 60 years of age with dyslipidemia and a BMI of 31kg/m2. Among those patients, 17.4% of them had HTN, 3.6% were diabetic and 3.6% were known to have deranged lipid profiles in laboratory studies (figure 3). The prevalence of obesity or overweight was low among those patients and >50%of them had a normal BMI between 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 as seen in Table 2. Discussion Valvular heart diseases often coincide with coronary artery disease (CAD) in older patients in Western countries, with varying prevalence rates across studies. For instance, Em\u00ad ren et al found significant CAD in 26.4% of Mitral stenosis patients and 57.7% of Aortic stenosis patients.6 Similar studies reported a high prevalence of CAD in Aortic disease (21.4%) and mitral valve disease (16.2%).7 Patients with aortic stenosis are more likely to have concomitant dis\u00ad ease.8This association is attributed to the pathophysiology of valvular diseases, leading to degenerative calcification that also affects coronary arteries. The prevalence of CAD is influenced by conventional risk factors such as hyperten\u00ad sion, male gender, dyslipidemia, smoking, and the type of valve lesion.7 In contrast, rheumatic valve disease, a consequence of acute rheumatic fever\u2019s abnormal immune reaction to strep\u00ad tococcal pharyngitis, has less impact on coronary vessels. Despite being the leading cause of cardiovascular deaths in children and young adults in low-middle-income coun\u00ad tries, rheumatic valvular heart disease typically progresses to heart failure without significantly affecting coronary ar\u00ad teries.9 Unlike age-related degenerative heart diseases, which involve calcification of heart valves and a high prevalence of concomitant coronary artery disease, patients with iso\u00ad The practice and results of age-based coronary study among patients 40 years and above undergoing valve \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 34 Table 1.

Studies have reported higher CAD prevalence in degenerative aortic valve dis\u00ad ease, non-rheumatic etiology, patients over 60 years, smok\u00ad ers, hypertensive and diabetic patients, and those with angina.3,10 Our study concurs with findings from Brazil by Kruczan et al., indicating the rarity of concomitant CAD among patients with isolated rheumatic valve disease.11 Most of Figure 3.

For ex\u00ad ample, a study by Boudoulas et al reported that the majority of patients who had mitral or aortic valve procedures un\u00ad derwent CABG at the same time at Ohio State University Medical Center between 2002 and 2008.3 While current ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines recom\u00ad mend coronary evaluation for valve surgery patients12,13 Our study questions the applicability of these guidelines to rheumatic heart disease populations, where the prevalence of concomitant CAD and valve lesions is lower. Our find\u00ad ings suggest that for isolated rheumatic valvular heart dis\u00ad ease, routine CAD screening can be safely avoided for pa\u00ad tients with minimal or no risk factors, minimizing financial burdens and avoiding surgery delays. Conclusions In conclusion, our study sheds light on the nuanced rela\u00ad tionship between rheumatic valvular heart disease and con\u00ad comitant coronary artery disease (CAD) in older patients. The findings underscore the rarity of significant CAD among those with purely isolated rheumatic valvular heart disease. Our study adds valuable insights, suggesting that routine screening for CAD in patients with isolated rheumatic valvular heart disease may not be necessary for most individuals without significant risk factors. This not only avoids unnecessary financial burdens on patients but also mitigates the risk of delayed surgeries that could be po\u00ad tentially lifesaving. Limitations It is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of our study. Being retrospective, it is susceptible to observational bi\u00ad ases, and the absence of some essential data, such as lipid profiles in certain cases, may impact the completeness of our findings. Additionally, the challenge of patients seeking coronary studies at different hospitals and not returning with the results introduces an element of uncertainty. Recommendations We recommend future prospective studies with a larger and more diverse sample to further elucidate these associations and contribute to refining clinical guidelines for this spe\u00ad cific patient population.

Uroflowmetry is an inexpensive, simple, and non-invasive follow-up urodynamic test that can evaluate the bladder and urethra\u2019s functionality post-valve ablation. This study sought to establish uroflowmetry as a valuable tool for patient follow-up by describing its patterns post-valve ablation at Kenyatta National Hospital. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on participants who underwent valve ablation from January 2014 to December 2020 at Kenyatta National Hospital and had completed toilet training. The uroflowmetry test was conducted according to the International Children\u2019s Continence Society standards for uroflowmetry. Data on demographics, voided volume, Q max, flow curve pattern, and post-void residual urine were analyzed with SPSS Version 26.0. Continuous data were presented as means and medians, while categorical data were shown as frequencies and percentages. Relationships and differences were explored using chi-square and paired sample t-tests. Results Out of 59 patients, 24 completed the uroflowmetry test, with a mean age of 6.6 years. There was a significant difference between the mean voided volume (139.08 mL (SD = 90.028) and mean expected bladder capacity (257.08 mL (SD = 98.576) (p < 0.001) post valve ablation, but no significant difference between observed (11.72 mL/s) and expected Q max (11.26 mL/s) (p = .596). Significant post-void residual was observed in 19 boys (79%). Conclusions Incorporation of uroflowmetry as a routine follow-up metric in LMIC protocols is valuable as it can provide useful adjuncts in detecting bladder dysfunction after valve ablation. INTRODUCTION In newborn males, posterior urethral valves (PUV) are the most common cause of lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO), affecting 1 in every 5000 to 8000 live births, and accounting for roughly 60% of all LUTO cases.1 Cys\u00ad toscopy and valve ablation via a transurethral incision (TUI), preferably within the first 4 to 16 weeks of life, is This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

A Single Centre Study in Africa on Voiding Patterns and Outcomes. East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(4):6-13. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.2 the definitive treatment for the bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), failure of which can result in severe urological se\u00ad quelae involving both the upper and lower urinary tract.2 Despite the relief of the anatomical BOO through ablation, long-term follow-up is necessary as lower urinary tract dys\u00ad function (LUTD) and renal damage have been found in up to 70% and 50% of cases respectively.2 This upper tract damage could be attributed to urethral stricture formation, the presence of residual valves, hypertrophy of the bladder neck, and/or overactivity and hypo compliance of detrusor muscles, all of which could occur following PUV ablation.2 Historically, the assessment of detrusor function post- PUV ablation relied primarily on symptomatology or ra\u00ad diographic abnormalities on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) ultrasonogra\u00ad phy, with cystoscopy serving to exclude urethral stricture or residual valve leaflets.1 However, these modalities were in\u00ad herently subjective. Comprehensive urodynamics emerged as the sole modality capable of giving accurate and objec\u00ad tive insights into detrusor function and can be done repet\u00ad itively to gauge post-intervention improvements.1 Uroflowmetry, the non-invasive component of UDS, is a simple, cost-effective modality for assessing bladder and urethral function that is widely used as a standalone exam\u00ad ination to assess a child\u2019s ability to empty the bladder and can, therefore, be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PUV ablation.3 Specifically, it can detect increased bladder out\u00ad let resistance by providing objective and quantitative data on free urinary flow rate throughout the micturition process by measuring the Qmax, voided volume (VV), flow pattern, and post-void residual volume (PVR).3 However, there is a paucity of data on the use of uroflowmetry as a follow-up study in paediatric patients after valve ablation in the African context, even though it is commonly advised as a first line in the assessment of LUTD.4 This study, therefore, aimed to establish uroflowmetry as a valuable and cost-effective technique for patient follow-up after valve ablation in a major referral hospital in Kenya by characterizing its patterns. Based on the findings, this study would help identify uroflowmetry as a tool for the early detection of LUTD, such as bladder dysfunction, a modifiable risk factor for renal damage, con\u00ad tribute to the pool of local data on the incidence of LUTD after valve ablation, and aid in the development of local guidelines and protocols for the management and follow-up of such patients. METHODS Study Design and Setting This was a cross-sectional hospital-based study conducted at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), the National Referral Hospital located in Nairobi, Kenya. The hospital is equipped with both infrastructure and personnel that rou\u00ad tinely manage PUV in children. The protocol for valve ab\u00ad lation in KNH is through a transurethral approach via a 9 Fr resectoscope on a cold knife. Valve ablation is done at 12, 5, and 7 o\u2019clock positions. A Crede maneuver is subse\u00ad quently performed to assess the adequacy of ablation, with a reassuring on-table stream considered adequate. Study Population As uroflowmetry is not routinely done as a follow-up test, the study recruited participants by recalling all patients who underwent PUV ablation at KNH between January 2014 and December 2020 and were currently on active follow-up in the unit\u2019s outpatient clinic. Patients who had not com\u00ad pleted toilet training were excluded. Data collection Primary data collection adhered to the \u201cInternational Chil\u00ad dren\u2019s Continence Society (ICCS) Standardization Report on Urodynamic Studies of the Lower Urinary Tract in Chil\u00ad dren.5\u201d Demographic information, current urological symp\u00ad toms, and medical history were recorded. Uroflowmetry was conducted in a dedicated Urology Centre near KNH with a digital automatic GRAVIMETRIC (Weight Type) Uroflowmeter (FLOW COMP \u00ae, model 106). Two uroflow measurements were performed for each patient to ensure accuracy, avoiding morning uroflows to prevent atypical voiding volumes. Data collected included VV, Qmax, flow curve pattern, and PVR.5 Pre-void and post-void bladder volumes were estimated using sonographic evaluation, with a significant PVR defined as more than 20% of the pre- void urine volume. A single trained staff member who rou\u00ad tinely performed uroflowmetry tests at the Urology Centre performed all the tests to maintain consistency. Expected Qmax values were calculated as the square root of esti\u00ad mated bladder capacity (EBC) for age.5 EBC (ml) was cal\u00ad culated by (age in years + 2) \u00d7 30 as the children were older than 2 years.6 Data Management and Analysis Data accuracy was verified, imported into Microsoft Excel for cleaning, and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were analysed using means with standard deviation or me\u00ad dians with interquartile ranges. Relationships and differ\u00ad ences within the dataset were explored using one-sample chi-square tests and paired sample t-tests. Data presentation was done through tables and graphs to facilitate interpreta\u00ad tion.

Written informed consent was obtained from all parents or guardians. RESULTS The data of this study consisted of 24 patients who under\u00ad went ablation of PUV at KNH between January 2014 and December 2020. The following flowchart (Figure 1) illus\u00ad trates patient selection and factors contributing to the com\u00ad pletion or non-completion of the uroflowmetry test among 59 eligible patients. Sample Characteristics Table 1 shows a summary of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients making up the sample. The mean age of the patients was 6.6 years (SD = 3.46). The mean age at diagnosis was 55.54 months (SD = 55.345, range = 1-224). The mean age at valve ablation was 57.42 months (SD = 54.810, range = 1-224), and the time gap be\u00ad tween valve ablation and uroflowmetry was 38.04 months (SD = 14.97, range = 19-78) Despite valve ablation, the boys experienced a range of LUTS, with terminal dribbling (25%) being the most com\u00ad mon voiding symptom, frequency (29.2%) the most fre\u00ad quent storage symptom, and incomplete emptying (25%) the predominant post-micturition symptom (Table 2). Uroflowmetry parameters Voided Volume and Q max The mean voided volume was 139.08 mL (SD = 90.028). The mean EBC was 257.08 mL (SD = 98.576). The mean expected Q max was 11.26 mL/s (SD = 3.59), while the mean observed Q max was 11.74 mL/s (SD = 5.24), as shown in Table 3. A paired-sample t-test was conducted to compare the mean VV and the mean EBC in millilitres (mL) in paedi\u00ad atric patients following the ablation of PUV. The results showed a significant difference between the mean VV (M = 139.08, SD = 90.03) and the mean EBC (ml) (M = 257.08, SD = 98.58); t (23) = -11.34, p < 0.001, 95% CI [-139.52, -96.48] with the mean VV being significantly lower than the mean EBC as shown in Table 4. A paired-sample t-test was also conducted to compare the mean observed and expected Q max following valve ablation. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the mean observed Q max (M = 11.74, SD = 5.24) and the mean expected Q max (M = 11.26, SD = 3.59); t (23) = -.537, p = .596, 95% CI [-2.35, 1.38] as shown in Table 4. Post Void Residual Sonographic assessment of bladder capacity post-micturi\u00ad tion revealed a significant residual urine volume of more than 20% of pre-void bladder urine volume in 19 partici\u00ad pants (79%) as shown in Table 5. Is Uroflowmetry a Valuable Tool for Posterior Urethral Valve Ablation Follow-Up? A Single Centre Study in \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 8 Uroflow curve patterns The most common flow pattern observed was the bell- shaped curve (58.33 %) as shown in Figure 2. One sample chi-square test was then conducted to com\u00ad pare the observed and expected frequencies of the flow pat\u00ad tern curves. The expected frequencies were based on the assumption that 50% of patients would exhibit a normal (bell-shaped) flow pattern, while the remaining 50% would be distributed equally among the four abnormal patterns (12.5% each). The results showed a chi-square value =2.33 and a cor\u00ad responding p-value=0.675 indicating no statistically signif\u00ad icant differences between the observed and expected fre\u00ad quencies. This confirmed the null hypothesis that the distribution of flow patterns did not significantly deviate from the assumed proportions. The observed frequency of the bell-shaped flow pattern was 58.33%, which was not significantly higher than the expected frequency of 50%. The observed frequencies of the other flow patterns also did not differ significantly from their expected frequencies of 12.5%: staccato 12.50%, plateau 4.17%, tower 8.33%, and interrupted 16.67%. DISCUSSION The mean age at presentation and PUV diagnosis in this study was 55.4 months (4.61 years), indicating a significant delay in diagnosis, which is consistent with reports from other LMICs like Nigeria (mean age 3.95 years) and Cameroon (median age 1.8 years).7 Common barriers to early diagnosis in these settings include limited access to prenatal ultrasound, poverty, parental ignorance, and inad\u00ad equate specialist care.7 In contrast, countries like Thailand and Iran report earlier detection, with a median age of 4.8 months in Thailand and 67% of cases in Iran diagnosed within the first month of life, largely due to increased uti\u00ad lization of prenatal ultrasound.8 In our study, most patients underwent valve ablation later than in other series, high\u00ad lighting delays in detection and referral commonly seen in LMICs.7,8 One important factor influencing renal outcomes has been identified as the age at valve ablation.9 Early age at valve ablation improves renal outcomes and lowers the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), while delayed abla\u00ad Table 1.

However, despite the later-than-expected time at di\u00ad agnoses, ablation was done promptly after diagnosis, with a mean age of 57.42 months, demonstrating timely action and the availability of specialists to manage PUV. Further\u00ad more, the gap between ablation and uroflowmetry of 38.04 months may have also altered bladder dynamics, with a longer delay between ablation and urodynamics being as\u00ad sociated with a higher prevalence of bladder dysfunction.9 Bladder dysfunction is a common irreversible comorbid\u00ad ity in patients with PUV post-ablation, occurring in about 55%.2 It is caused by chronic obstruction, which disrupts normal bladder cycling and causes bladder wall modifi\u00ad cations such as muscle hypertrophy and fibrotic remod\u00ad elling, eventually leading to an unyielding bladder with elevated resting pressure and decreased bladder capacity. Ultimately, the bladder hostility worsens hy\u00ad droureteronephrosis, and gradually, renal failure devel\u00ad ops.13\u201117 Our findings revealed that the observed Qmax did not substantially differ from the mean expected Qmax values, indicating a favourable outcome of valve ablation in terms of restoring urethral patency, which can otherwise be ob\u00ad structed by remaining valves, strictures, or bladder neck stenosis.18 Additionally, we discovered that in the 24 boys who underwent ablation, the mean VV post-ablation was significantly lower than the mean EBC, suggesting either a decrease in bladder capacity or an increase in PVR. To better understand which of the two was most likely, PVR was calculated by subtracting the mean pre-void volume (279.05mls) from the mean actual voided urine as per uroflowmetry (129.52mls). It was then observed that 19 boys (79%) showed a considerably high mean PVR (149.52 mls). Existing urodynamic literature on PUV mainly fo\u00ad cuses on comprehensive evaluations of bladder function pre- and post-ablation, with limited studies examining Is Uroflowmetry a Valuable Tool for Posterior Urethral Valve Ablation Follow-Up?

A Single Centre Study in \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 10 Figure 2. Graphical presentation of the flow curve pattern frequency on uroflowmetry in the 24 boys valve ablation uroflowmetry values for PVR (81 vs 64 mls), maximal bladder capacity (149 vs 167 ml), and Qmax (6 vs 8 ml/s), suggesting that valve ablation did not restore nor improve bladder function.19 Other previous investiga\u00ad tions have found a significant increase in the incidence of PVR among patients with PUV post-ablation, with three theories being detailed concerning PVR in the absence of bladder outlet obstruction21,22. The first theory proposes a true residual caused by a hypo-contractile overdistended bladder causing incomplete emptying. The second theory is that pseudo-residuals are caused by urine reflux into the upper tract, which then refills the bladder after voiding. The third explanation is pseudo-pseudo-residuals from a hydronephrotic polyuric kidney.23\u201125 Although our study lacked pre-ablative uroflowmetry parameters for compari\u00ad son, a high PVR was observed in 19 boys (79%), which was most likely due to a combination of true, pseudo, and pseudo-pseudo residual urine, with mechanical obstruction being unlikely given the average recorded Qmax. To deter\u00ad mine which of the three was the primary cause of the PVR, additional procedures such as VCUG, cystography, or the Whitaker test would have been required.24 The remaining 5 boys had no significant PVR, as their mean pre-void blad\u00ad der capacity (190 mls) matched their mean actual voided volume (175.4 mls), indicating normal detrusor contractil\u00ad ity and no mechanical obstruction. The flow pattern curve analysis revealed that majority of the boys, 58.3%, had a normal (bell-shaped) flow pattern while 41.7 % had abnormal curves. A normal flow pattern is frequently associated with both low intraurethral pressure and normal detrusor contractility.5 Conversely, while the flow pattern may help identify the mechanism underlying LUTD, neither a typical nor abnormal pattern guarantees the presence of LUTD due to compensatory voiding mech\u00ad anisms such as the use of abdominal muscles.5 As a result, it is impossible to determine whether our participants had a normal curve pattern due to normal detrusor contractions or if it was caused by a urinary system compensating mecha\u00ad nism. The flow pattern curve analysis should, therefore, not be read separately but in conjunction with the Qmax since combining the two provides a better knowledge of lower urinary tract function and can aid in the identification of patients who may require additional intervention or treat\u00ad ment.26 STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS The study recruited participants from a specialized referral centre with a standardized protocol for PUV ablation, en\u00ad suring consistent surgical and post-operative practices. It followed the ICCS standards, with a single trained staff member conducting all uroflowmetry tests to maintain re\u00ad liability. However, the study also faced several limitations. The small sample size and study design were not powered to make conclusive inferences on the subject under study. While the results provide important insights into the post- ablation urodynamic effects in PUV patients, further prospective research with larger, more representative sam\u00ad ples is necessary to confirm these findings and enhance their generalizability. Additionally, while uroflowmetry is a helpful non-invasive tool, its results can be influenced by factors such as hydration status, diurnal variation, psycho\u00ad logical state, and environmental conditions, particularly in paediatric patients. These limitations suggest the need for more invasive urodynamic tests to detect subtle abnormali\u00ad ties. CONCLUSION Uroflowmetry did not find any statistically significant dif\u00ad ference between the mean expected and observed Q max in our cohort of patients after PUV ablation, suggesting ade\u00ad quate urethral patency after ablation. However, 79% of par\u00ad ticipants had significant residual urine volume, and 41.7% had abnormal uroflowmetry curves, which suggested sig\u00ad nificant bladder dysfunction. Incorporation of uroflowme\u00ad try as a routine follow-up metric in LMIC protocols can, therefore, provide useful adjuncts in detecting bladder dys\u00ad function after posterior urethral valve ablation. Uroflowme\u00ad try seems a valuable non-invasive adjunct to follow-up in PUV management.

It is a mechanical failure of a healing abdominal surgical wound. The incidence of abdominal wound dehiscence ranges from 0.4 to 3.5%, and it can reach 10% in the elderly. Despite advances made over the past decades in perioperative care and suture materials, incidence and mortality rates of abdominal wound dehiscence have not changed markedly. Objectives The purpose of this investigation was to determine the magnitude and predictors of abdominal wound dehiscence in patients who underwent laparotomy at two hospitals in Sidama regional state, Ethiopia, in 2023. Methods We employed a case-control study design to determine the magnitude and implicated risk factors of abdominal wound dehiscence among pediatric and adult patients who underwent laparotomy for various indications between April 1, 2018 and January 31, 2023 at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital and Yirgalem hospital medical college. We analyzed a sample size of 196 patients (63 cases and 133 controls). Using the Kobo toolbox, data were captured from the operation theater log book and chart review and exported to SPSS version 26 for analysis. The results of descriptive and analytical analyses were presented using tables, graphs, and charts. Results The extent of abdominal wound dehiscence was determined to be 1.66%. Place of residence, AOR = 13.94 (95% CI: 3.57-54.45), post-operative complications, AOR = 20.40 (95% CI:6.79-61.25), anemia, AOR = 4.01 (95% CI: 1.32-12.17), and emergency surgery, AOR = 10.17 (95% CI:2.28-45.25), were all statistically significant Conclusion We propose that special attention be paid to those from rural areas and those who undergo emergency surgery. Preventing postoperative complications and addressing the root cause of anemia as much as possible is critical. 1. INTRODUCTION Abdominal wound dehiscence (AWD) is a mechanical fail\u00ad ure of a healing abdominal surgical wound. The incidence of abdominal wound dehiscence ranges from 0.4 to 3.5%, and it can reach 10% in the elderly. The associated mor\u00ad tality rate reaches up to 45%.1\u20119 Several studies identify various combinations of factors as risk factors, which are typically classified as local and Systemic factors.2,10 Pa\u00ad tient-related comorbidities and procedure-related parame\u00ad ters such as surgery type, incision and closure type, and operation time are among the risk factors. Nevertheless, wound infection is the most crucial factor.7,9,11\u201115 This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(4):14-23. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.3 AWD remains a serious postoperative complication de\u00ad spite technological and surgical advancements. This is pre\u00ad dominantly due to the influence of patient-specific factors.8, 16,17 AWD is regarded as a reliable indicator of patient safety due to its influence on morbidity, duration of hospital stay, including intensive care therapy, readmission rate for another surgery, and health care costs.6,8,11,12 AWD and other wound complications increase healthcare costs and prolong hospital stays due to increased morbidity, resulting in significant economic and psychosocial strain on the pa\u00ad tient and the healthcare system. The burden AWD places on an already overburdened healthcare system in places like Ethiopia should not be underestimated.14,18\u201120 There are various modifiable risk factors for AWD that can help re\u00ad duce the occurrence of this devastating condition. Identify\u00ad ing high-risk patients in advance would enable the surgeon to take preventative measures during surgery, such as the application of a retention suture or the use of absorbable or non-absorbable meshes.6,17 The purpose of this study is to determine the risk factors and magnitude of AWD in two selected hospitals in the Sidama region of Ethiopia. So far, there have been only two reports of this dreadful condition in Ethiopia. The first was performed at St. Paul\u2019s Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The other was done at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital and involved only pediatric patients.2,18 Both studies re\u00ad vealed the magnitude of AWD in their respective contexts, as well as potential risk factors for AWD, including emer\u00ad gency surgery, surgical site infection, and intrabdominal sepsis. Both studies lacked a comparison group to reach their conclusion, which we deemed a major drawback, and the later study only included pediatric cases. Unlike the two studies, this one is a case-control study that includes people of all ages. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study site and period The research was carried out at the departments of surgery at two facilities in the Sidama Region, Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (HUCSH) and Yir\u00ad galam hospital medical college, from February to May 2023. The Sidama area is located in southern Ethiopia. The region\u2019s major crops are \u2018enset\u2019, wheat, teff, and barley, as well as cereals and coffee as cash crops. Hawassa is the cap\u00ad ital city of the Sidama region. It is located 274 kilometers south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\u2019s capital city. HUCSH is a tertiary hospital in Hawassa, Ethiopia. It is the only teach\u00ad ing-specialized referral hospital in the region. It is a referral center for patients from the region and nearby areas. It de\u00ad livers services to almost 20 million people. Yirgalem hos\u00ad pital medical college is 315 kilometers from Addis Ababa. It serves a population of approximately 4 million people. 2.2. Study design A case-control study was used to find out the risk factors for abdominal wound dehiscence and its frequency in pa\u00ad tients who had undergone laparatomy for different reasons at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospi\u00ad tal (HUCSH) and Yirgalem hospital medical college in the department of surgery. 2.3. Source and study population The source population was all patients who had undergone laparotomy at the two study hospitals. The study population comprised surgical patients from the surgical departments of the chosen hospitals who underwent laparotomy within the last five years and developed AWD for cases, and con\u00ad trols who underwent laparotomy within the same time frame (April 1, 2018 to January 31, 2023) but did not de\u00ad velop AWD. All pediatric and adult patients who had la\u00ad parotomies during the five-year period (April1, 2018 to January 31, 2023), both elective and emergency surgeries, were included and patients transferred out, died or referred were excluded 2.4. Data collection and Data analysis The data were collected using software called the Kobo Toolbox. This was done once a patient was identified from the operation room (OR) log books using a patient-specific identification number (chart number), which was used to re\u00ad trieve the patient\u2019s chart. Three surgical residents entered the data into the Kobo toolbox. The number of laparotomies was obtained from the OR log books. The operating theater (OR) log book of the selected hospitals was used to identify patients, and data were extracted from April 2018\u2013 January 2023. For each identified case of AWD, two controls were selected. Controls were not matched to cases based on any specific characterstics. Controls were people who under\u00ad went lararotomy and did not develop AWD. Any two con\u00ad secutive cases on the OR log book close to the identified case of AWD were taken as controls. Chart review: Three surgical residents reviewed the pa\u00ad tients\u2019 charts. Two residents of HUCSH and one resident of Yirgalem hospital medical college were assigned. Chart numbers were traced from the OR log book, and charts of a specific patient, both a case of AWD and respective con\u00ad trols, were reviewed thoroughly. The data was then entered into the Kobo toolbox. The data included socioeconomic characteristics, preoperative risk assessment, and intraoper\u00ad ative and postoperative risk assessment. After editing, the data were exported from the Kobo toolbox to SPSS software version 26 for analysis. Descrip\u00ad tive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were used to summarise the study participants relationship to the study variables. Texts, tables, and charts were used to display the results. Chi-squared test ,Fisher\u2019s exact tests, and Mann- Whitney U test were used as appropriate, to explore the as\u00ad Determinants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study East and Central African Journal of Surgery 15 sociation between categorical variables. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the re\u00ad lationship between individual potential risk factors and the event. Consequently, the factors that were statistically sig\u00ad nificant (p < 0.05) or clinically pertinent to the event were incorporated into a multivariable binary logistic regression model to ascertain independent predictors. Results were presented using crude odds ratios (COR), adjusted odds ra\u00ad tios (AOR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values. All significance tests were two-tailed and P<0.05 was con\u00ad sidered significant. Variables which do not fulfill the as\u00ad sumptions of biniary logistic regression were exluded from both univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses. 3.2. Ethical considerations Ethical clearance was obtained from the Hawassa Univer\u00ad sity College of Medicine and Health Science Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB number is IRB/069/14. 4. RESULTS We included 196 patients and 63 were cases of abdominal wound dehiscence and 133 were controls. The total number of laparotomies performed during the study period was 3792, of which 1270 (33.5%) were elective and 2522 (66.5%) were emergency procedures. 1206 (31.8%) were pediatric patients, and 2586 (68.2%) were adults. The mag\u00ad nitude of abdominal wound dehiscence in our study was 63 (1.66%). Socio-demographic characteristics Out of the study subjects, only five (7.93%) of the cases were above the age of 61. As to place of residence, those from rural areas accounted for 66 (33.67%), while those from urban areas accounted for 48 (24.5%). (Table 1). Pre-operative conditions In our study, regarding the preoperative risk assessment, 37 (65%) of cases versus 20 (35%) of controls had anemia, with a P-value of <0.001. The majority of cases underwent (58 of 63, 92.1%) emergency surgery, compared to 86 out of 133 controls (64.7%). (Table 2) Intraoperative and postoperative risk assessment variables Regarding the type of surgical incisions, 47 (74.6%) of the cases and 61 (45.8%) of the controls underwent a midline vertical incision, which is the commonest type of incision. Of the hospital deaths, most were cases (13, 76.5%). (Table 3). In our study, 54 (85.7%) of the cases had an acute ab\u00ad domen of different etiologies. Intestinal obstruction of var\u00ad ious benign pathologies, followed by appendicitis and its complications, were the commonest intraoperative diag\u00ad noses among cases of AWD (25 and 15 cases, respectively). (Fig.1) Abdominal wound dehiscence and its features 58 out 63, 92.1% of the cases developed a complete wound dehiscence. About two-thirds of the cases (42 out of 63, 66.7%) developed WD within 6\u201310 days after laparotomy. The majority (88.8%) of the cases were re-operated . Exlud\u00ad ing those who died, the median length of hospital stay was significantly longer for cases (22 days; IQR: 13.75\u201330) compared to controls (6 days; IQR: 3\u20139; p < 0.001, Mann- Whitney U test).(Table 3) Trend of abdominal wound dehiscence The trends of AWD in the study hospitals showed decreas\u00ad ing trends from late 2018 to early 2019, and the trend plateaued in the subsequent three years (until late 2021) with a yearly case of 13. However, the trend dropped faster, from 13 to 8 cases in 2022 until early 2023. (Figure 2). Factors associated with WD Variables were put into the binary logistic regression model for univariate and multivariable analyses. When possible confounding factors were taken into account, place of res\u00ad idence, anemia, emergency surgery, and the presence of post-operative complications were significantly associated statistically with abdominal wound dehiscence. (Table 4) 5. Discussion The study found a magnitude of 1.66% and a variety of fac\u00ad tors to be statistically linked with AWD in the study area. These included the patients\u2019 residency, post-operative com\u00ad plications (SSI, anastomotic leak, HAP), anemia, and emer\u00ad gency surgery. This hospital-based study showed that the magnitude of AWD was 63 (1.66%). This was slightly higher than the study done in St. Paul,Ethiopia (0.99%).2 This value is comparable with a study done in Sarajevo and India.6,12,15, 16 Even though the incidence differs across hospitals and settings, it is consistent with the global report stating the wound dehiscence (WD) ranges from 0.4\u20133.5.1\u20115,7\u20119 How\u00ad ever, in a study done in pakistan, it was 4.42%,3 it was 6.9% in a study done in Argentina10 and a study done in a uni\u00ad versity set up in Egypt ,the frequency was 7.3%.17 Another study done in addiss ababa,Ethiopia which was on pediatric cases showed an incidence of 7.9%.18 The high incidence in these studies could be due to the presence of multiple co\u00ad morbidities, poor nurtritional status, delayed presentation, a higher proportion of emergency surgeries or due to ad\u00ad Determinants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study East and Central African Journal of Surgery 16 Table 1.

Regarding place of residence, patients who lived in rural areas were statistically more likely to experience AWD than those who didn\u2019t. This discovery has never been men\u00ad tioned in prior studies. This is one of the study\u2019s original findings. The patients\u2019 poor nutritional status or their de\u00ad layed presentation to medical facilities due to access or knowledge issues could be the causes, but this variable needs more research. The study identified postoperative complications as a strong risk factor for AWD and were associated with a twenty-fold increased risk of wound dehiscence. Previous, comparable studies supported our evidence .2,4,5,7,11,15,17, 18,20,21 Emergency abdominal surgery was another significant risk factor that was determined to be strongly associated with AWD. Patients who underwent emergency abdominal surgery in this hospital-based study had higher odds of de\u00ad veloping AWD (AOR = 10.17) than those who underwent elective procedures. In a case-control study carried out in Poland, this was thoroughly validated.5 The patient\u2019s poor overall health, the high likelihood that the surgical wound will become contaminated, and the possibilities that the surgical team\u2019s performance may be jeopardized are some of the contributing factors. Of the cases in our study, 54 (85.7%) had acute abdomens of various etiologies. This is consistent with a number of other studies, including those conducted in Egypt and India, where 70% of AWD cases had an acute abdomen.4,15,17,22 In these studies, viscus per\u00ad foration from a variety of etiologies was the main contribu\u00ad tor to acute abdomen. In the Addis Ababa, Ethiopia study, acute abdomen was the main contributing factor.2 Intestinal obstruction and acute appendicitis with its complications were the two most frequently performed pro\u00ad cedures among the cases. In 57 cases (90.47%), the patholo\u00ad gies were benign. In contrast, a Sarajevo study discovered that the majority (40.1%) of abdominal wound dehiscence cases occurred following surgery for colorectal cancer and Determinants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study East and Central African Journal of Surgery 18 Figure 1. Summary of the Intraoperative diagnoses of the cases of abdominal wound dehiscence and controls, Sidama region, Ethiopia, 2023 Figure 2. Trends of AWD with respect to total laparotomy done each year, Sidama region, Ethiopia, 2023 that 52.2% of all cases of abdominal wound dehiscence were malignant.16 84.9% of the patients in a Turkish study had undergone surgery for a malignancy.20 Our research shows that malignancy is much less frequent than benign pathologies, which may be because malignancy is uncom\u00ad mon in younger populations. However, due attention should also be paid to benign pathologies to minimize the develop\u00ad ment of abdominal wound dehiscence. Our research also revealed that anemia was a significant risk factor for AWD. The odds of developing AWD were approximately four times higher in patients who had un\u00ad dergone laparotomy and had anemia than in patients who did not. This is supported by earlier comparable studies conducted elsewhere that show strong associations between anemia and wound dehiscence.11,15,16 But in another study done in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia no strong association was found between anemia and wound dehiscence.18 In this study 61(96.8%) of the cases had a long hospital stay compared to 44 (33.1%) of the controls. This is sig\u00ad nificant with a P-value of <0.001. This demonstrates how abdominal wound dehiscence increases a patient\u2019s hospital stay with its associated consequences. This has been demonstrated in several studies. A case-control study con\u00ad ducted in Poland showed that the increased length of hospi\u00ad tal stay among cases was statistically significant compared to controls .5,7 This was also demonstrated in a study con\u00ad ducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.18 In the current study, majority (67%) of the wound de\u00ad hiscences\u2019 developed within 6 to 10 days of post laparo\u00ad tomy. The findings is in line with similar study conducted in addis ababa,Ethiopia revealing 58.5% of WD happened within similar time period.2 It is also similar with a study done in Pakistan.3 In a study done in Argentina majority of the cases occurred on the 9th post-operative day.10 Accord\u00ad ing to Ramshort et.al 90% of cases of abdominal wound de\u00ad hiscence occur before the 15th post-operative day.16 In this study, males (38 of 63, 60.3%) experienced ab\u00ad dominal wound dehiscence. Numerous studies have found that to be the case.2,3,15,16 In fact, age (being older) and sex (being a man) are two risk factors that are frequently mentioned in studies.10,11,19 In a study conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, there was no connection between sex and wound dehiscence.18 In our study, (44 out of 63, 69.8%) of the abdominal wound dehiscence cases were between the Determinants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study East and Central African Journal of Surgery 19 Table 4.

This was comparable to the St. Paul, Ethiopia study.2 The same was the case with an Indian study.22 The high proportion of young people in the study population may be the cause of this. Similar research was conducted in India, where the majority of cases were in their fourth decade of life.15 In contrast, a study conducted in Sarajevo found that the majority of cases occurred in people between the ages of 71 and 80.16 In our study, only 5 (7.93%) of the cases were over the age of 61. In contrast to some studies where the majority of the population was elderly, age and gender were not discovered in this study to be independent risk factors for the devel\u00ad opment of wound dehiscence. This was discovered in both an Egyptian and an Indian study.21,23 Age and gender were not found to have a statistically significant association in a case-control validation study carried out in Poland .5,7 Only 5 (7.9%) of the cases in this study had COPD, hy\u00ad pertension, or diabetes mellitus (DM) as comorbid condi\u00ad tions. This might be as a result of the higher percentage of young patients in this study than in other studies. As a re\u00ad sult, these people have hardly any co-morbidities. COPD is one of the main independent risk factors documented in the literature.10,11 In contrast, a study conducted in Turkey found no evidence that COPD was significantly linked to the emergence of wound dehiscence.20 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY It is challenging to extrapolate the study\u2019s results to the country or the continent as a whole because it is facility- based and only includes two centers. Given that the sec\u00ad ondary data were retrieved retrospectively from patient medical records, another limitation of the current study is the incompleteness of the records of some variables that might have an association with abdominal wound dehis\u00ad cence and led to exclusion of them in regression analyses. 6. CONCLUSION In this study, an AWD of 1.66 was found, and it was found that the patients\u2019 place of residence, postoperative compli\u00ad cations (SSI, anastomotic leak, HAP), anemia ,and emer\u00ad gency surgery, were all significant predictors of AWD de\u00ad velopment. We suggest giving patients from rural areas and those undergoing emergency surgery more attention. Prompt measures should be taken to prevent the develop\u00ad ment of postoperative complications; the root cause of ane\u00ad mia must be addressed whenever possible. Every patient\u2019s medical history must be meticulously recorded. 7. RECOMMENDATIONS This study is one of the few to evaluate the magnitude of abdominal wound dehiscence and its risk factors in the country. Future studies might involve many patients and multiple centers prospectively. This would make it possible to identify independent risk factors more precisely, allow\u00ad ing us to identify patients who are at a high risk of devel\u00ad oping dehiscence and quickly take the necessary preventive actions.

Motorcycle users are highly vulnerable to accidents, resulting in rising orthopedic related morbidity and mortality. In Malawi, the surge in motorbike taxi services has led to a notable increase in motorbike-related road accidents. Objectives This study aimed to assess the pattern of orthopedic injuries, examine demographic characteristics, and analyze the mechanisms of injuries among motorcycle trauma patients admitted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Malawi. We included all orthopedic surgery data from ward admissions records from January to December 2021. Data were extracted from patients\u2019 files and stored on REDCap and analyzed using SPSS version 27. Results A total of 502 motorbike and non-motorbike road traffic trauma patients were recorded in the inpatient orthopedic trauma database. Of these, 453 patients\u2019 files were identified and analyzed, while 9.7% (49/502) files were missing. Amongst the 453 patients\u2019 files identified, those that suffered motorcycle injuries were 63.4% (287/453) of all road traffic accidents. Most of these accidents occurred in urban areas 64.1% (168/266). The age range was 8 to 78 years with most falling within age group of between 21 and 40, 53.7% (154/287). The majority, 78.7% (226/287), were male. Collisions between motorcycles and cars were the most common mechanism of injury 41.6% (119/286). Motorcycle drivers constituted the largest group of victims 42.8% (118/276) and majority of victims did not use helmets 83.1% (74/89). The most frequent orthopedic injury pattern was fractures of the tibia and fibula accounting for 44.6% (128/287) of injured patients, with highest likelihood of being open 57.8% (59/102). Greater number of orthopedic injuries, 70.1% (199/284), were treated surgically. The commonest duration of hospital stay was ranging from 1 week to 1 month with most being discharged within 14 days, 43.9% (125/285). Conclusion Motorcycle related accidents is public health challenge in Malawi and similar LMICs, leading to a high burden of morbidity and mortality, primarily affecting the productive age group with long impact on health system to spend long time in hospital, requiring surgical provision. Policymakers should consider preventive measures, as the treatment of these injuries strains already limited hospital resources and contributes to poor patient outcomes.

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(4):24-35. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.4 INTRODUCTION Globally, road traffic accidents (RTA) are on the rise with motorcycle users being among the most vulnerable groups. They are prone to encountering high morbidity and mortal\u00ad ity. According to World Health Organization (WHO), ap\u00ad proximately 1.3 million people globally die each year due to road traffic crashes, with 20 to 50 million more people sustaining non-fatal injuries leaving them with significant disabilities.1 Approximately 93% of the world\u2019s fatalities on the roads happen in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) even though roughly 60% of the world\u2019s vehicles dwell in these settings. It is estimated that more than half of all road traffic deaths are among vulnerable users including motorcyclists.1 The burden of Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) is on the rise, causing significant economic losses to individuals, their families, and nations. Even in developed countries, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents. The economic bur\u00ad dens resulting from these accidents are multifaceted, stem\u00ad ming from treatment costs, loss of productivity and valu\u00ad able working time for victims and relatives, loss of skilled labor force, and loss of school hours. Road traffic accidents impose substantial economic costs, with most countries los\u00ad ing approximately 3% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually.1 Furthermore, RTIs have become the lead\u00ad ing cause of death among people aged 5-29 years, dispro\u00ad portionately affecting vulnerable groups such as pedestri\u00ad ans, cyclists, and motorcyclists, particularly those living in developing countries.1,2 It is estimated that approximately 770 million motorcy\u00ad cles are on the roads worldwide, engaging in various ac\u00ad tivities.3 In developing nations, motorcycles are utilized for essential responsibilities related to transportation and eco\u00ad nomic activities. Motorcycle accidents account for more than 380,000 annual deaths globally, with 28% of fatalities occurring in 2016, primarily in the African region.2,3 Sub- Saharan Africa, in particular, faces a rapidly increasing bur\u00ad den of trauma from road accidents, which has been termed \u201cAfrica\u2019s silent epidemic\u201d.4 In developing countries, motorcycle injuries have be\u00ad come a pressing yet overlooked public health concern, sub\u00ad stantially contributing to road traffic accidents and fatali\u00ad ties.5,6 In spite of the increased risks which is reported to be 30 times more likely to be fatal and eight times more likely to result in injury compared to other vehicles, motorcycles are increasingly popular due to their convenience.7 Com\u00ad mercial motorcycling has become widespread in rural and urban areas, leading to significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where young people rely on motorcycles for transportation and livelihood, driven by high unemployment rates.5 Malawi is experiencing rapid economic growth and a surge in motor vehicle registrations, including motorcycles. The country\u2019s estimated road traffic fatality rate stands at 35 deaths per 100,000 people per year, the second-highest globally.8,9 In Malawi, as in other developing countries, motorcycle road traffic accidents are rising due to increased motorcycle taxi operations. Most motorcyclists operate ille\u00ad gally, lacking driver\u2019s licenses and helmets, putting them\u00ad selves and vulnerable road users at greater risk. Their lim\u00ad ited knowledge of road traffic rules exacerbates this risk. Consequently, crash victims often present to hospitals with various injuries, frequently including orthopedic trauma. Despite the growing number of trauma patients and sub\u00ad standard care leading to poor outcomes, research remains scarce. This study aimed to investigate patterns of orthope\u00ad dic injuries, demographic characteristics, and injury mech\u00ad anisms among motorcycle trauma patients admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital. METHODS AND MATERIAL A retrospective study was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), the largest referral and teaching hospital in Blantyre, southern Malawi. QECH primarily serves the southern region, comprising 13 districts with a population of approximately 7.75 million.10 Due to the lack of a district hospital in Blantyre, QECH also provides pri\u00ad mary and secondary services. The hospital has a bed capac\u00ad ity of 1,200. Data on road traffic accident (RTA) patients from Jan\u00ad uary to December 2021 were retrieved from an electroni\u00ad cally maintained orthopedic database. This information fa\u00ad cilitated the location and identification of patients\u2019 files from the hospital\u2019s Health Management Information Sys\u00ad tem (HMIS) office. All available patient files admitted to orthopedic wards due to RTA were collected, and the total number was recorded. From this total, only files of patients involved in motorcycle accidents were selected and stored using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The following data were collected: demographics (age, gender, education status, occupation, and place of resi\u00ad dence); accident details (accident scene, mechanism of in\u00ad jury, patient\u2019s role, and helmet use); clinical information (presenting features, associated injuries, treatments, and du\u00ad ration of hospital stay); and treatment outcome (discharged or deceased). Injury patterns were noted by reviewing doc\u00ad umented diagnoses based on clinical and radiographic as\u00ad sessments. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, with categorical variables presented as frequencies and per\u00ad centages, and continuous variables described using means and standard deviations. For inferential statistics, the chi-square test was em\u00ad ployed to examine the association between dependent and independent variables. Additionally, binary logistic regres\u00ad sion analysis was conducted to determine the magnitude and direction of association, yielding crude and adjusted odds ratios. All inferential statistical tests were performed Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi East and Central African Journal of Surgery 25 Figure 1. Total Number of Road Traffic Injured Patients Admitted to Orthopedic Wards with Different Modes of Injury at a 95% confidence level using SPSS version 27. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study received approval from both the Hospital Re\u00ad search Committee and College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee (COMREC). RESULTS A total of 502 road traffic trauma patients were recorded in the inpatient orthopedic trauma database. Of these, 453 patients\u2019 files were identified and analyzed, while 49 files, representing 9.7% (49/502), were missing and hence not analyzed. Among the 453 analyzed patient files, 287 pa\u00ad tients, representing 63.4%, (287/453), suffered motorcycle injuries, accounting for the majority of road traffic acci\u00ad dents (Fig. 1). Demographic Features of the Groups Commonly Involved in Motorcycle Accidents. Gender Most of the victims in this study were male, 78.7% (226/ 287) whereas 21.3% (61/287) were female. Age The age range of patients was 8 to 78 years, with the major\u00ad ity falling within the productive age group of 21 to 40 years, 53.7% (154/287). The mean age was 34.4 (SD 13.8). Education Data on education status was unavailable for 69.3% (199/ 287) of patients. Among the remaining patients with avail\u00ad able data, 40.9% (36/88) had attended primary education as their highest level of education, 27.2% (24/88) of patients had attended secondary education, 20.4% (18/88) of pa\u00ad tients had attended tertiary education. Notably, 11.4% (10/ 88) of patients did not attend any formal education. Occupation Occupation status data was available for only 38.3% (110/ 287) of patients. Among these, the majority were business\u00ad people, including motorbike taxi operators, accounting for 45.5% (50/110) of the sample. Workers/employees com\u00ad prised 22.7% (25/110) of the patients, followed by farmers at 19.1% (21/110) and students at 12.7% (14/110). Area of Occurrence of Motorbike Accidents There was missing data in 7.3% (21/287) of the study popu\u00ad lation about the area of occurrence of motorbike accidents. However, among those with available data, urban areas had a higher incidence rate of motorcycle accidents, 64.1% (168/266), compared to rural areas, 35.9% (94/266). The highest rate was observed in Blantyre urban, 56.7% (151/ 266), and very few in Blantyre rural, 6.8% (18/266). The referral cases from areas outside Blantyre accounted for 36.5% (97/266). Role of the patient Data on the patient\u2019s role at the time of the accident was available for 96.2% (276/287) of the study population. The majority of victims were motorcycle drivers, 42.8%, (118/ 276), followed by passengers, 36.2% (100/276) and pedes\u00ad trians 21.0% (58/276). Relationship between Socio-demographic Characteristics and Motorcycle Accidents Involvement A chi-square test at a 95% confidence level examined the association between patients\u2019 demographic characteristics Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi East and Central African Journal of Surgery 26 and their involvement in motorbike accidents. For this analysis, involvement was categorized as active (drivers/ passengers, referred to as motorbike users) or passive (pedestrians, referred to as non-motorbike users). The results, presented in Table 2, reveal significant asso\u00ad ciations between active involvement in accidents and three demographic factors: age (p = 0.001), accident site (p = 0.014), and area of residence (p = 0.013). Conversely, no significant relationships were found between active in\u00ad volvement and gender (p = 0.38), occupation (p = 0.371), or education (p = 0.179). Based on logistic regression analysis, patients aged 21-40 were 3.15 times more likely to be actively involved in motorbike accidents compared to those aged 0-20 (AOR 3.15, 95% CI: 1.433-6.939). Similarly, patients aged 41-60 had a 3.5-fold increased likelihood (AOR 3.5, 95% CI: 1.332-9.185). Conversely, patients over 60 were 65% less likely to be involved (AOR 0.349, 95% CI: 0.09-1.36). Patients with urban accident locations were 1.35 times more likely to be actively involved in motorbike accidents than those with rural locations (AOR 1.348, 95% CI: 0.323-5.617). In Blantyre, urban residents had a 1.36-fold increased likelihood of active involvement compared to rural residents (AOR 1.364, 95% CI: 0.317-5.863). No\u00ad tably, residents outside Blantyre district (referral areas) were 3.54 times more likely to be actively involved than Blantyre rural residents (AOR 3.54, 95% CI: 0.939-13.35). Mechanism of Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients Only one victim (0.3%, 1/287) lacked data on motorcycle injury mechanism. Among those with data, collisions be\u00ad tween motorcycles and cars were the most common injury mechanism, accounting for 41.6% (119/286) of cases (Table 3). Outcome on Discharge Three patients (3/287) lacked discharge outcome documen\u00ad tation, resulting in 1% missing data. Among those with data, the majority were discharged home, 97.5% (277/284), while 2.5% (7/284) died during treatment. Notably, 85.7% (6/7) of deceased patients had concomitant non-orthopedic injuries, and 71.4% (5/7) succumbed within 7 days of or\u00ad thopedic admission. Relationship between Demographic Characteristics, Injury Mechanism, Length of Hospital Stay and Survival (Treatment Outcome) A chi-square test analyzed the relationship between gender, age, injury mechanism, length of stay, and discharge out\u00ad come. The results, presented in Table 4, showed significant associations between discharge outcome and two variables: injury mechanism (p = 0.017) and length of stay (p = 0.001). In contrast, no significant relationships were found between discharge outcome and gender (p = 0.621) or age (p = 0.500). Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients in\u00ad volved in motorbike-car collisions were 14.76 times more likely to die compared to those with non-motorbike car col\u00ad lisions (AOR 14.76, 95% CI 1.619-34.65). Non-motorbike car collisions included falls from motorbikes after losing control, motorbike-motorbike collisions, and pedestrians hit by motorbikes. Regarding hospital stay duration, patients staying over a week were 95.8% less likely to die compared to those stay\u00ad ing less than a week (AOR 0.042, 95% CI 0.007-0.242). This indicates that deceased patients were more likely to die within the first week of admission. Patterns of Orthopedic Injuries in Motorcycle Accidents. The most frequent orthopedic injury pattern was lower limb fractures, with the tibia and fibula being the most common among the patients, 44.6% (128/287), followed by femur fractures 30.7% (88/287) (Table 5). A similar trend in injury patterns was observed across both genders, with tibia and fibula fractures being the most common (Fig. 2). Similarly, tibia and fibula fractures pre\u00ad dominated across age groups, except among those under 20, where femur fractures were most prevalent (Fig. 3). Relationship between Gender, Age, Mechanism of Injury and Injury Pattern A chi-square test of association was conducted to examine the relationship between gender, age, mechanism of injury, and patterns of injury. Injury patterns were categorized into lower limb fractures and upper limb fractures. Mechanisms of injury were classified into two groups: vehicle collisions (e.g., motorbike-motorbike, motorbike-car collisions) and non-vehicle collisions (e.g., falls from motorbikes after los\u00ad ing control, being hit by a motorbike). The results showed no statistically significant association between any of the variables and injury patterns (p > 0.05). Fracture Patterns: Open vs. Closed Closed fractures comprised 64.5% (185/287) of all frac\u00ad tures, while open fractures accounted for 35.5% (102/287). Among the open fractures (n=102), tibia/fibula fractures represented 57.8% (59/102). A chi-square test of associa\u00ad tion between fracture location and openness revealed a sig\u00ad nificant correlation between tibia/fibula fractures and in\u00ad creased likelihood of being open (p=0.001). Notably, 46.1% (59/128) of tibia/fibula fractures were open. Based on the logistic regression analysis, patients with tibia/fibula fractures were 2.31 times more likely to have an open fracture compared to those with other fractures com\u00ad bined (odds ratio: 2.307; 95% CI: 1.409-3.777).

For those with available data, the majority of orthopedic injuries underwent surgical treatment (70.1%, 199/284), while 29.9% (85/284) received non-surgical/conservative treatment. The most common du\u00ad ration of hospital stay ranged from 1 week to 1 month, with the majority (43.9%, 125/285) being discharged within 14 days (Table 1). Associated Non-Orthopedic Injuries Among orthopedic ward admissions, 16.7% (48/287) sus\u00ad tained concurrent non-orthopedic injuries. Head injuries were the most common associated non-orthopedic injuries, Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi East and Central African Journal of Surgery 28 Table 2.

DISCUSSION Motorcycle usage in Malawi, mirroring trends in other de\u00ad veloping countries, is experiencing exponential growth as a primary transportation mode.8 However, this increase is accompanied by a concerning rise in road traffic accidents. Our study revealed that nearly two-thirds (63.4%) of trauma orthopedic admissions resulted from motorcycle accidents, aligning with Banza et al.'s study (2018) which reported that vulnerable road users, including motorcyclists and pedestrians, accounted for nearly two-thirds of road traffic injuries.8 The widespread disregard for traffic rules and regulations among motorcycle riders, coupled with the lack of licensure among the majority on public roads, plays a significant role. Additionally, the inherent vulnerability of motorbikes due to their lack of protective features com\u00ad pared to enclosed vehicles further elevates the risk. Conse\u00ad quently, these factors increase the likelihood of accidents and injuries among motorcyclists and other vulnerable road users.11,12 Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi East and Central African Journal of Surgery 29 Table 4.

This disparity may be attributed to the higher mo\u00ad torcycle usage in urban areas, driven by increased business activity and commuting. Furthermore, elevated road traffic in urban areas increases the likelihood of collisions with other vehicles. However, potential biases in case reporting may also contribute to this disparity. Specifically, some or\u00ad thopedic trauma patients from district accidents may not be referred to our facility, while severely injured patients from distant areas may succumb to injuries before arrival. No\u00ad tably, Blantyre\u2019s lack of a district hospital funnels patients directly to our facility, potentially increasing Blantyre ur\u00ad ban accident numbers. The majority of patients involved in motorbike accidents were businesspeople, including motorbike taxi operators. This finding is consistent with previous studies highlighting the increased risk of road traffic injuries among commercial motorcyclists.11 The high representation of motorbike taxi operators in our findings may be attributed to their in\u00ad creased exposure to road traffic, prolonged working hours, and potentially hazardous driving practices. Additionally, workers/employees, farmers, and students were also com\u00ad monly involved in motorbike accidents. This study revealed that 78% of motorcycle injury vic\u00ad tims were males in their reproductive years, likely attribut\u00ad able to socioeconomic factors. Men are more likely to use motorcycles as employment or transport to their job. It is not uncommon to see men driving motorcycles and engag\u00ad Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi East and Central African Journal of Surgery 30 Table 5.

Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries in Males and Females ing in taxi services, whereas women are predominantly pas\u00ad sengers or pedestrians, often victims of these accidents. No\u00ad tably, no female victims in this study were the drivers at the time of accidents reflecting societal norms influenced by cultural backgrounds. Young men frequently engage in leisure driving, increasing their likelihood of drinking and driving, speeding, and other risky behaviors. Consistent with prior research, males in their productive years exhibit high motorcycle accident rates due to reckless riding prac\u00ad tices, including helmet avoidance, overloading, speeding, and substance-impaired driving.11\u201113 A significant proportion of motorcycle accident victims had a low educational background, with a substantial ma\u00ad jority having only completed primary education as their highest level of educational attainment. This finding is con\u00ad sistent with existing research, which has consistently demonstrated that individuals with elementary education are disproportionately represented in motorcycle road acci\u00ad dents, and are more likely to experience high case fatali\u00ad ties.14,15 Individuals with little or no education are likely to come from low socioeconomic background and therefore are inclined to choosing the cheapest mode of transporta\u00ad tion including motorcycles. They are also likely to engage in motorbike taxi operations as their business to generate income to support their families. Generally, less educated people are less likely to drive cautiously, less aware of traf\u00ad fic rules and regulations and therefore prone to fatal acci\u00ad dents. Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi East and Central African Journal of Surgery 31 Figure 3. Patterns of Orthopedic Injuries Across all Age Groups In this study, collisions between motorcycles and other vehicles were found to be the most common mechanism of injury, consistent with observations in similar studies.11, 16\u201118 Motorcycle drivers themselves were the most frequent victims of accidents, followed by passengers. As most mo\u00ad torcycle riding occurs in urban settings, where other vehi\u00ad cles are numerous, the likelihood of motorcycles colliding with cars is high, particularly when navigating through traf\u00ad fic congestion. In developing countries, poor road condi\u00ad tions, overspeeding, and overloading of vehicles and mo\u00ad torcycles with passengers or luggage increase the risk of collisions between motorcycles, other vehicles and pedes\u00ad trians. This situation is exacerbated by a lack of understand\u00ad ing and/or adherence to road traffic signs and signals among many road users. Several studies have demonstrated that motorcycle trauma victims present to hospital with different pattern of injuries including neurosurgery, general surgery and ortho\u00ad pedic surgery trauma conditions but orthopedic injuries are commonly encountered.5,12 The most common pattern of orthopedic injuries in this study was that of lower limbs with fractures of tibia/fibula being the commonest followed by femur fractures. Our findings are consistent with similar studies done elsewhere which demonstrated similar pattern, with the fractures of tibia/fibula being the commonest.7,11, 12,19 Due to anatomical position and superficial subcuta\u00ad neous location of the tibia/fibula, they are prone to frac\u00ad ture and are highly susceptible to becoming open fractures during road traffic accidents.20,21 Notably, our study found that 46.1% of all tibia fractures were open. However, of all the fractures together, 35.5% were open with tibia/fibula fractures accounting for 57.8% of these open fractures. The global burden of orthopedic injuries is substantial, exerting significant pressure on healthcare resources, in\u00ad cluding in low-resource settings like Malawi. The conse\u00ad quences of these injuries are devastating, affecting not only the individual but also their families and communities. Pro\u00ad longed hospitalizations result in increased healthcare uti\u00ad lization, reduced productivity, and long-term disability.11 Our study\u2019s findings indicate that hospital stays for ortho\u00ad pedic injuries ranged from less than 7 to more than 30 days, with a median duration of 14 days. Injury severity, pat\u00ad tern, and treatment modality significantly influenced hospi\u00ad talization duration. Notably, surgical intervention was the primary treatment approach, yielding shorter hospital stays compared to conservative management with skeletal or skin traction. This is consistent with existing literature, which highlights the impact of multiple injuries and comorbidities on prolonged hospitalization.11 This study found a 2.5% mortality rate among orthope\u00ad dic ward admissions, contrasting with similar studies done in Egypt (1.9%) and Pakistan (1.1%).11,12 The higher mor\u00ad tality rate in our study may be attributed to concomitant life-threatening non-orthopedic injuries, potentially over\u00ad looked or missed during admission. Our study found that those that died, 85.7% had concomitant non-orthopedic in\u00ad juries and head injury was the commonest. Other study findings have revealed head injury as the leading cause of death in trauma patients.12,22 Most deaths (72.7%) occurred within 7 days of admission, but specific causes of death were not recorded in our study. Notably, when considering all motorbike trauma pa\u00ad tients, regardless of whether they sustained orthopedic and/ or other injuries, the mortality rate exceeds the rate ob\u00ad Patterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi East and Central African Journal of Surgery 32 served in our study.12,13,17 Our findings indicate that col\u00ad lision between motorcycle and a car was significantly as\u00ad sociated with increased mortality, likely attributable to the high-energy impact and resultant multiple injuries. The study\u2019s reliance on patient file data introduces po\u00ad tential biases and limitations characteristic of retrospective research. Specifically, missing and incomplete data were encountered in some variables under investigation. Another limitation stems from the potential bias introduced by miss\u00ad ing patient\u2019s files and the exclusion of multisystem injured patients admitted to wards outside the orthopedic depart\u00ad ment. Furthermore, this single-centered study creates a se\u00ad lection bias that potentially would affect external validity. These limitations may impact the generalizability and representativeness of the findings. To address these con\u00ad cerns, future studies should consider several key improve\u00ad ments. Specifically, adopting multicenter designs would en\u00ad hance external validity, while comprehensive data collection strategies would minimize missing values. Addi\u00ad tionally, employing inclusive criteria would capture diverse patient populations, and implementing strategies to mitigate selection bias would strengthen the reliability of the results. Furthermore, conducting prospective studies would provide more accurate and reliable data. Despite the limitations, this study contributes signifi\u00ad cantly to our understanding of the epidemiological char\u00ad acteristics surrounding motorcycle accidents. The findings have important implications for prevention strategies, pol\u00ad icy development, and healthcare resource allocation fo\u00ad cused on mitigating the impact of motorcycle accidents. Fu\u00ad ture research can enhance these results by employing more superior study designs, ultimately yielding higher-quality evidence to inform motorcycle safety initiatives. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS Motorcycle accidents are a frequent cause of road traffic accidents and pose a significant public health challenge in Malawi. These accidents lead to a high burden of morbidity and mortality, primarily affecting the productive age group, young men in particular, leading to socioeconomic down\u00ad fall on individual family and the country at large. We recommend that policymakers should consider pre\u00ad ventive measures, as the treatment of these injuries strains already limited hospital resources and contributes to poor patient outcomes. Such preventive measures include edu\u00ad cational campaigns through various media, enforcement of traffic rules and regulations including making sure the mo\u00ad torcycle drivers undergo an appropriate training before li\u00ad censure. We also recommend that the responsible authority should restrict operation of motorcycle taxi (locally called kabaza) in busier public roads, for example, in city urbans where most of the motorcycle accidents occur as shown in this study. In addition, improving safety of road infrastruc\u00ad ture through introduction of pavements and special road crossing for pedestrians in busier public roads are other im\u00ad portant safety measures.

Omondi, M.D 1 a 1\u00a0Orthopedic Unit, General Surgery, University of Nairobi Keywords: referral guidelines, health facility referrals, Kenyatta National Hospital https://doi.org/10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.5 East and Central African Journal of Surgery Vol. 29, Issue 4, 2024 Abstract Background Inappropriate utilization of higher level health facilities and ineffective management of the referral processes is characterized by self-referrals and frequent bypassing of nearest health facilities coupled with low formal referral mechanisms. This leads to unnecessary congestion at a high-cost health facility and compromises the ability and capacity of Kenyatta National Hospital to function as a referral facility as envisioned by Kenya Health Sector Referral Implementation Guidelines of 2014, Kenya 201 constitution and Kenyatta National Hospital legal statue of 1987. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of enforcement of national referral guidelines on health facility referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital. Methods This was a pre-post intervention test study design. The study was conducted amongst the orthopedic health facility referrals in 2021 with 222 and 246 before and after enforcement of the national referral guidelines respectively. This was done in Orthopedic Department at Kenyatta National Hospital. The variables collected were the healthy facility, location of health facility, health facility tier, type of health facility (government or private) and facility related factors associated with healthy facility orthopedic referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital. Data collection was done through data abstraction. Data was analyzed using frequency distribution, pearson chi-square test and logistic regression. Results Nairobi County and its environs constituted over four-fifth of all health facility referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital. Enforcement of the national referral guidelines was significant reduction in health facilities levels 2 and 3 referring patients directly to Kenyatta National Hospital after enforcement of national referral guidelines (p=0.002). About 43 health facilities ceased referring patients to Kenyatta National Hospital with over two-thirds of these health facilities being private facilities. The major facility and patient factors that were associated with health facility referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital were human resource capacity and availability and patient\u2019s preference. Conclusion Enforcement of the national referral guidelines significantly reduced the lower tiers health facilities referring to Kenyatta National Hospital. We recommend having written standard operating procedures on referrals based on the national referral guidelines with continued enforcement of the same to sustain the gains made.

Closing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a tertiary teaching and referral hospital, Kenya: pre-post intervention study design. East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(4):36-45. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.5 Background Tertiary hospitals in resource-limited countries are ex\u00ad pected to treat patients referred but in most cases are the first point of contact for the vast majority of patients.1 This is because of inappropriate utilization of tertiary health fa\u00ad cilities that results in patients\u2019 congestion in referral hospi\u00ad tals with simple medical conditions that can be effectively managed at the lower peripheral health facilities. The ma\u00ad jority of these patients are self-referred, bypassing lower- level health facilities in the process.2\u20115 A study done in Lusaka, Malawi and in South Africa demonstrated how the tertiary health facilities were con\u00ad gested due to bypassing of lower peripheral health facilities. The urban phenomenon of widespread self-referral was as\u00ad sociated with low rates of formal referral from peripheral health facilities.4,6,7 The net result is overcrowding, long waiting times, and scarce staff time consumed by lesser medical conditions at the expense of complex medical con\u00ad ditions. It is therefore imperative that attempts need to be made to ensure patients make use of lower health facili\u00ad ties.1,8 The bypassing of lower level health facilities also cripples the primary health care system and this effectively ensures that primary health care facilities remain underused and inefficient.9 Taken together, this jeopardizes the appro\u00ad priate delivery of primary, secondary, and tertiary health care. A cross-sectional study done to review the self-referrals to a District-Regional Hospital in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa showed 36% were self-referrals. However, majority (64%) were appropriately referred with written referral let\u00ad ters.7 A study on referral system in Nigeria showed that 92.9% reported to tertiary hospital directly without referral while 7.1% were referred. The result of this is overcrowding of the tertiary facilities with conditions that can be managed at lower level health facilities.8 Kenya is a low and middle-income country. Kenya\u2019s health sector is one of the 14 functions devolved to the 47 county governments as provided for in the Fourth Sched\u00ad ule of the 2010 constitution.10 There are 6(six) different levels of health care in Kenya. Levels 1 - 5 are managed by the county government and level 6 by the national gov\u00ad ernment (Figure 1). In this system patients are required to move from one level to the next using a formal referral let\u00ad ter. Level 4 are Sub-County Hospitals, Nursing Homes and also include medium-sized private hospitals. Level 5 are County Teaching and Referral Hospitals, large private as well as faith-based hospitals. Level 6 are National Teaching and Referral Hospitals. In Kenya there are four teaching and referral hospitals: a) Mathari Hospital, b) Kenyatta Na\u00ad tional Hospital (KNH), c) Moi Teaching and Referral Hos\u00ad pital and d) National Spinal Injury Hospital. These level 6 offer range of services similar to level 5 but additionally Figure 1: Six Levels of health care service delivery in Kenya11 they offer specialised treatments in addition to having ad\u00ad vanced infrastructure. KNH was established as a National Referral and Teach\u00ad ing Hospital, to provide training and medical research in 1901 and became a State Corporation in 1987.12 According to the KNH Board order of 1987 contained in the Legal Notice No. 109, the functions of KNH were spelled out as a) to receive patients on referral for specialized health care; b) to provide facilities for medical education for the University of Nairobi and other health allied courses; c) to contribute to national health planning.12 This understand\u00ad ing has been reinforced by the Kenya Health Sector Refer\u00ad ral Implementation Guidelines, 2014, and the Constitution of Kenya 2010.10,13 Orthopaedic wards in KNH have consistently recorded the highest bed occupancy percent for the last couple of years. In 2018, 2019 and 2020 it recorded bed occupancy percent of 142.2%, 138.2% and 116.5% respectively against the KNH bed occupancy percent of 106.2%, 113.4% and 91.5%.14 This coupled with low nurse-patient ratio of 1:10 compromises not only the quality of nursing care given to patients but also the ability of KNH to ef\u00ad fectively perform its statutory obligations. Various studies have demonstrated that an appropriate nurse-patient ratio is associated with the reduction in medical errors, decubitus ulcers, hospital-acquired infections, long duration of hospi\u00ad tal stay, high readmission rates, and compromised patient well-being and safety due to the nurse burnout.15\u201117 On 1st July 2021, KNH management made a decision to enforce the Kenya Health Sector Referral Guidelines 2014. This meant that patients were to be seen based on referral letters from other health facilities to reduce the number of walk-in patients who would have otherwise been appropri\u00ad ately seen at the peripheral health facilities. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of enforcement of refer\u00ad ral guidelines on orthopaedic facility referrals to KNH and the associated factors. Closing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a tertiary teaching and referral hospita\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 37 Methods Study design This was a pre-post intervention study design. The national referral guideline was enforced on 1st July, 2021. The pre- intervention covered 5 months before enforcement of refer\u00ad ral guidelines (February 1, to June 30, 2021) while post- intervention covered 5 months after enforcement of the referral guidelines (August 1, to December 31, 2021). Study area This study was conducted in Orthopaedic Department at KNH. KNH is the largest teaching and referral hospital in East and Central Africa. KNH Orthopaedic Wards were the study area. KNH is based in Upperhill, Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. Study duration The study duration was from 1st February 2021 to 31st De\u00ad cember 2021. The referral guidelines were enforced from 1st July 2021. Data abstraction was conducted from 1st Jan\u00ad uary to 31st March, 2022. Study population Orthopaedic admissions referred to KNH before and after enforcement of the national referral guidelines. Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Sample size calculation Sample size was calculated using an adjusted Casagrande formula for calculating sample sizes that compare two bi\u00ad nomial distributions.18 A sample size of 468 facility referrals were enrolled dur\u00ad ing the study period with 220 and 248 facility referrals be\u00ad fore and after the enforcement of national referral guide\u00ad lines. Recruitment and sampling procedures Three (3) research assistants (RAs) were recruited to collect and abstract patient data from patient files. The RAs were health care workers with a diploma in Orthopedic Trauma and with some experience in research data collection. The Principal Investigator (PI) was the research coordinator for the data collection. The orthopedic admissions with facility referrals were identified from the a) admission desk of Health Information System at KNH Accident and Emer\u00ad gency Unit (A&E) b) KNH Orthopedic Outpatient clinic records (OC) c) KNH Corporate Outpatient Care (COC). They were then recorded in a logbook. This logbook served as a master register for all facility referred patients admitted and therefore the sampling frame for the study. All facility admissions were logged into the logbook from the admis\u00ad sion books stationed in these three (3) services points. Prob\u00ad ability Proportional to Size (PPS) was then used to decide on the numbers to be sampled per month from each of these three services points so that the sample size would be a rep\u00ad resentative of the admissions by month from each of these three orthopedic admissions entry points (Table 1). The three (3) RAs were reporting to and working under the direction of the PI. The RAs were trained for two (2) days by the PI on the research protocol, data collection tools, data collection procedures and that included pilot testing of the data collection tools as well before the actual data abstraction. Variables a) Name of health facility County b) health facility location c) Facility Type (Government/Private) d) Health Facility Level/Tier e) Admission date (dd/mm/yyyy) e) health facil\u00ad ity related factors associated with orthopaedic referrals to KNH Data collection procedures Data collection was done through a data abstraction form from the patient files retrieved from KNH Health Records and Information Office. Data Abstraction form \u2013 The three (3) RAs were trained on the data abstraction using a data abstraction form as per the research protocol. The PI reviewed all the filled-in ab\u00ad straction forms for completeness and accuracy daily during the entire data collection period and providing regular feed\u00ad back to the RAs on a timely manner to ensure data qual\u00ad ity and compliance to the study protocol. All the completed and verified data abstraction forms were then collected and filed by the PI at the end of every week under a lockable cabinet. Ethical considerations The study protocol was presented to UoN/KNH Ethics and Research Committee and was granted ethical approval (ERC No: P852/10/2021). Administrative approval was also granted by KNH Medical Research Department and KNH Orthopaedics Department. 1. All orthopaedic facility referrals to KNH during the study period. 1.

For anonymity and confidentiality pur\u00ad poses the data abstraction tool were marked only with the participant study numbers and no names were used. How\u00ad ever, the research assistants and the PI had access to the patients charts and therefore could identify individual pa\u00ad tients during the data collection period. The data were en\u00ad tered into a password-protected Redcap database kept by the KNH Medical Research Department. The data were an\u00ad alyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies while inferential statistics using Pearson\u2019s chi-squared tests, logistic regression were used. The calcu\u00ad lations were done at a 95% level of confidence. Findings Basic Profile of the sample population A total of 468 charts were abstracted of which 220 (47%) were before and 248 (53%) were after the enforcement of the referral guidelines. Nairobi County constituted more than half of facility re\u00ad ferrals to KNH. This rose to over four \u2013 fifths of facility re\u00ad ferrals with inclusion of the neighbouring counties namely Kajiado, Kiambu and Machakos. Almost all the facility re\u00ad ferrals were from within Kenya (Table 2). About three-fifths of the facility referrals to KNH were government health facilities with private health facilities comprising about two-fifths. About half of the facility refer\u00ad rals are from levels 2 to 4 and with the remainder of facility referrals to KNH from levels 5 and 6 (Table 2). Closing the gap on the referral system Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital and Thika Level 5 Hospital were the major health facilities referring patients to KNH before and after enforcement of the referral guidelines (Figure 2). There were increases in the health facility referrals to KNH after the enforcement of the referral guidelines. How\u00ad ever, these increases were not statistically significant (Table 3). There were statistically significant differences in health facilities referrals to KNH before and after the enforcement of the referral guidelines when stratified by the health facil\u00ad ity level (Table 4). There was significant reduction in lev\u00ad els 2 and 3 referring patients directly to KNH and an in\u00ad crease in the facility referrals to KNH from level 4, 5 and 6 (Table 4). There were less level 2 and 3 health facilities referring patients to KNH after enforcement of the referral guidelines. The facility referrals from level 2 were 90.8% less likely as compared to level 3 after enforcement of the referral guidelines (p=0.002) (Table 4). While the study showed about 43 health facilities ceased referring patients to KNH with over two-thirds of these health facilities being private facilities (Table 5). The study revealed that lower levels health facilities namely levels 2 - 4 ceased referring patients to KNH and this comprised over four-fifths of all health facilities that stopped referring to KNH after enforcement of the referral guidelines (Table 5). The major facility and patient factors that were associ\u00ad ated with facility referrals to KNH were human resource capacity and availability, health facility infrastructure, Or\u00ad thopaedic equipment\u2019s and implants availability, patient\u2019s preference, financial considerations (Table 6).

This is in tandem with studies done at tertiary teaching and referral health facilities in Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria that Closing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a tertiary teaching and referral hospita\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 41 revealed significant majority of the facility referrals are from within the region where the health facilities are co-lo\u00ad cated.8,19\u201122 Most of the facility referrals to KNH are from govern\u00ad ment health facilities with private health facilities compris\u00ad ing about one-third. This compares favourably with a study done in Rwanda that showed approximately 85.7% of the facility referrals were from public hospitals while 10.7% of the referrals were from private health facilities.23 Similarly a prospective study done at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania to examine the medical referral pattern of patients in 2004, revealed that about 22.4% of admissions were from public health facilities while only 4.2% were from private health facilities.24 Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital and Thika Level 5 Hospital were the major health facilities referring patients to KNH before and after enforcement of the referral guidelines and they all happen to be government health facilities \u2013 which comprise majority of health facil\u00ad ity referrals to KNH as compared to private health facility referrals. This is probably because of inadequate human re\u00ad source, inadequate infrastructure like bed capacity, theatre space as well as lack of orthopaedic equipments and im\u00ad plants. However, this contrasts with a study on referrals to a tertiary health facility in Nigeria that showed over half of the admissions were from private health facilities.8 In addi\u00ad tion, St Peters Orthopaedic and Surgical Speciality Centre, St Francis Community Hospital, Arthi River Shalom Com\u00ad munity Hospital and St Mary\u2019s Mission Hospital were the most frequently referring private health facilities to KNH for orthopaedic admissions in 2021. These were probably due to inadequate human capacity, patients\u2019 preference and financial considerations. There were increases in the number of health facilities referring patients to KNH after the enforcement of the re\u00ad ferral guidelines. This is in tandem with a study done in Republic of Hondura that showed the referral rate was ob\u00ad served to be higher when institutional managers empha\u00ad sized the importance of the referral system.4 The enforce\u00ad ment of the national referral guidelines meant more awareness on the referral requirements and importance of referrals of patients to the next level of care and this might have resulted in increase in the number of health facilities referring patients. The enforcement of the national referral guidelines was meant to streamline the referral process from the peripheral health facilities to KNH and in the process allow KNH to manage complex orthopaedic cases that cannot be han\u00ad dled at the lower-level health facilities. All potential refer\u00ad ring health facilities were required to refer patients to the next level of health facility instead of referring directly to KNH and the higher level health facilities were expected to seek concurrence before referring patients to KNH and that should be accompanied with an official referring letter. Due to the enforcement of these referral requirements, there was significant reduction in lower levels 2 and 3 health facilities referring patients directly to KNH and an increase in the pa\u00ad tients being referred to KNH from levels 4, 5 and 6. The study showed about 43 health facilities ceased re\u00ad ferring patients to directly to KNH with over two-thirds of these health facilities being private facilities. This is in tan\u00ad dem with a study on Geographic accessibility to public and private health facilities done in Kenya in 2021 that revealed the private health facilities\u2019 distribution was skewed toward the urban counties.25 The implication of this is that a good number of private health facilities were no longer referred patients directly to KNH. Lower levels health facilities namely levels 2 and 3 largely reduced patient referrals to KNH and this together with level 4 comprised over four-fifths of all health facili\u00ad ties that stopped referring to KNH after enforcement of the referral guidelines. This is because these lower-level health facilities were now required to refer patients to the near\u00ad est level 4 and 5 health facilities as their first referral point. This means that the enforcement of the national referral guidelines did reduce referrals from lower level health fa\u00ad cilities and probably were referring them to the next tier fa\u00ad cility. This may explain why the numbers of higher levels referring patients to KNH increased after the enforcement of the referral guidelines. Human resource capacity remains a major factor in health facility referrals both for private and government health facilities. Inadequate human resource does also com\u00ad prise the quality of care provided at the health facilities. This is in tandem with a study finding in Kenya that re\u00ad vealed Human resources for health was inadequately fi\u00ad nanced with insufficient number of health workers and there was maldistribution of staff in favor of higher-level facilities and in urban cities and this resulted in unnecessary referrals to higher level consequently compromised quality of primary healthcare.26\u201128 A number of studies in Brazil, Japan, United States of America and in Low- and Middle- income countries have also demonstrated inadequate hu\u00ad man resource capacity and availability as the main reasons for patient referrals.29\u201133 However, this contradicts a study done in China on types of health care facilities and the qual\u00ad ity of primary care revealed that Community Health Cen\u00ad ters offer quality health care services than the secondary and tertiary health care hospitals.34 This was largely due to the fact that it was Chinese deliberate government policy to support and improve the capacity of the Community Health Centers. Private health facility referrals to KNH were to a signif\u00ad icant extent dictated by patients\u2019 preference. This could be due to perceived good quality of care but also due to per\u00ad ceived low cost of medical care in KNH by virtue of it be\u00ad ing a government national referral hospital. Studies done in California, USA and Islamic Republic of Iran, Cape Town, South Africa did show that the perception of good quality of care does influence choice of health facility.3,35\u201137 The study had a few limitations. Firstly, the possible effect of COVID 19 pandemic on health facility referrals Closing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a tertiary teaching and referral hospita\u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 42 from peripheral health facilities. This was mitigated by en\u00ad suring the data collection period covered the covid period where intercounty movement restrictions were lifted. Sec\u00ad ondly, this study is retrospective and a quasi-experimental study design and hence weaker in determining causality. Despite these limitations, given the paucity of published lit\u00ad erature in this study topic, this study offers key information on the effects of enforcement of referral guidelines in health facility referrals to KNH with important lessons for Kenya and similar settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Conclusions The enforcement of the national referral guidelines did re\u00ad duce the number of facility referrals from lower level health facilities with a good number of private health facilities stopped referring patients to KNH altogether. The major fa\u00ad cility and patient factors that were associated with facility referrals to KNH were human resource capacity and avail\u00ad ability, health facility infrastructure, Orthopaedic equip\u00ad ment\u2019s and implants availability, patient\u2019s preference, fi\u00ad nancial considerations. Therefore, it is possible to successfully enforce the implementation of referral guide\u00ad lines. Recommendations Recommendations to Policy Makers/ County Government Recommendations to KNH Recommendations to Health Facilities 1. Regularly sensitize the health facilities on the imple\u00ad mentation of the national referral guidelines 2014 for continued enforcement of the referral guidelines; 2. Strengthen the human resource capacity and avail\u00ad ability to minimize on referrals to KNH and this will consequently strengthen the primary and tertiary level orthopaedic and trauma care and help decongest KNH and allow it to function as a premier referral fa\u00ad cility as per its statutory obligations; 3. Develop, disseminate and train health facilities on standard operating procedures based on the national referral guidelines and ensure adherence to the same. 1. Educate and sensitize the health facilities on the role of KNH as a premier National Teaching and Referral facility that is mandated to manage complex referrals and should not be the first point of contact for patients seeking orthopaedic care; 2. Develop, disseminate and train KNH staff from A&E department, Orthopedic Clinic and Corporate Outpa\u00ad tient Centre on the national referral guidelines and re\u00ad ferral standard operating procedures. 1. Ensure adherence to the national referral guidelines of 2014 for an effective referral process and to en\u00ad sure optimum utilization of primary, secondary and tertiary level of care.

A gangrenous transverse colon in a congenital diaphragmatic hernia is even rarer in adults. The study aims to demonstrate a gangrenous colon in congenital diaphragmatic hernia at 23 years. The patient presented with features of intestinal obstruction and respiratory distress. The chest radiograph indicated a large bowel in the left chest cavity. CT scan of the chest confirmed a diaphragmatic hernia with its complications. The histological diagnosis was gangrenous colon in keeping with strangulated hernia. At laparotomy, a left diaphragmatic defect of 4-5 cm and a gangrenous transverse colon in the left chest cavity were found. The gangrenous colon was resected and created a transverse colostomy. A left thoracostomy tube was inserted. After 3 months the colostomy reversal was done and the recovery was uneventful. The report demonstrated a rare case of gangrenous colon in a congenital diaphragmatic hernia at 23 years managed by surgery via an abdominal approach. Introduction A diaphragmatic hernia (DH) is a congenital or acquired di\u00ad aphragm defect that allows intra-abdominal viscera to nav\u00ad igate into the chest cavity.1,2 DH is classified into postero\u00ad lateral, anterior, or central with the posterolateral hernia (Bochdalek hernia) being the commonest congenital DH ( 95 %).1,3,4 Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) arises from the failed fusion of the diaphragmatic embryonical component (around 8 weeks of gestation) with resultant ab\u00ad normal lung development.5 Congenital DH is common in neonates with an incidence of 0.8\u20135/10,000 live births.1,4,6 Among adults, CDH is rare and usually incidental.4 Ar\u00ad guably, the prevalence could be as high as 20% even though mostly asymptomatic.3 Furthermore, acquired diaphrag\u00ad matic hernias are rare and due to trauma (<1% of all trauma).6 Its rate increases to three percent in abdominal injuries.6 DH is more common in males.7 DH risks incar\u00ad cerating and strangulating abdominal viscera.6 Complicated DH is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 31%.6 The symptomatic cases present with nonspecific abdom\u00ad inal and respiratory complaints. However, pain is the most common symptom (69%).4,6,7 Besides the clinical assessment, several modalities exist to diagnose DH. They include chest radiographs, barium studies, Computer Tomography (CT) scans, and Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the CT scan is the most preferred modality as it confirms the diagnosis and de\u00ad tects herniated contents and complications.2,5 DH is managed by surgery either via laparotomy (com\u00ad monest), or laparoscopic approach.6,7 Operative approach is influenced by the patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability, as\u00ad sociated conditions, and the surgeon\u2019s expertise.6 Patients who present with features of incarceration, gangrene, or perforation of hernia content warrant emergency surgery.5 The abdominal approach remains the most preferred This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

Depending on the size of the de\u00ad fect, diaphragmatic hernia can be primarily repaired with sutures or tension-free mesh.6 The case report aims to demonstrate a gangrenous colon in a congenital diaphragmatic hernia at 23 years. Case presentation A male 23 years old presented with abdominal pain, disten\u00ad sion, vomiting fecal matter, and constipation. He had diffi\u00ad culties breathing. There was no history of thoracoabdomi\u00ad nal trauma or surgery. The drug history was unremarkable and a cattle herder who never smoked or consumed alcohol. On examination, BP 120/76mmhg, P-120bpm, Sat 84% room air and 96% on oxygen. Temp 37.5 degrees Celsius, respiratory rate 24. The patient was fully conscious and had dry mucous membranes. There was neither pallor nor jaundice. Chest examination revealed reduced air entry and dullness on the left side. A cardiovascular exam revealed heart sounds in the right hemithorax. The abdomen revealed epigastric fullness, tenderness, and guarding. The digital rectal exam was non-revealing. The laboratory revealed hemoglobin of 15.00g/dl, leuco\u00ad cytosis (WCC 27.01x10^9/L), neutrophilia 83.1%, and ele\u00ad vated C-reactive protein CRP 474.5mg/l. The biochemistry revealed potassium of 3.9 mmol/L, sodium of 141 mmol/ L, elevated urea of 16.6 mmol/L, creatinine (150 \u00b5mol/L), hypoalbuminemia of 32 with elevated bilirubin of 61umol/ l, alkaline phosphates 152U/l and normal transaminases. The chest /X-ray showed left pleural effusion and shift\u00ad ing of the mediastinum to the right side (Figure 1). The ab\u00ad dominal X-ray revealed a distended loop of large bowel in the left and right upper quadrants (Figure 2). The CT scan of the chest confirmed herniation of the colon into the left chest cavity, mediastinal shift to the right, pleural effusion and significant compression of the left lung (Figure 3). Once the diagnosis was made, intravenous (IV) fluid re\u00ad suscitation, administered IV antibiotics ceftriaxone 1g BD 5/7 and metronidazole 500mg TDS 5/7, kept the patient nil per mouth, inserted a nasogastric tube, catheterized, and consented to emergency laparotomy. In the emmer\u00ad gency room, a left thoracostomy tube was inserted for left pleural effusion (serosanguinous fluid). At laparotomy, a left diaphragmatic defect of 4 to 5cm (Figure 4) and a gangrenous transverse colon in the left chest cavity were found (Figure 5). The gangrenous part of the transverse colon was resected and created a temporary transverse end colostomy (Figure 6) while the distal descending colon stump was closed. Peritoneal and chest lavage was with co\u00ad pious amounts of warm saline. The histological diagnosis was gangrenous colon in keeping with strangulated hernia. After 3 months, reversal of transverse end colostomy was Figure 1. Chest radiograph showing left pleural effusion and shifting of the mediastinum to the right side Figure 2.

Discussion The final diagnosis was gangrenous transverse colon in left congenital diaphragmatic hernia. A diaphragmatic hernia at 23 years old is a rare entity and the Bochdalek hernia re\u00ad mains the most common in 70 to 95% of cases.5,8 Even though common in neonates, it could be due to blunt or pen\u00ad etrating thoracoabdominal trauma in adults.2 Nonetheless, our patient did not have a history of trauma. In a systematic review of 192 cases of left-sided CDH, there was a male predominance (50.5% males) with a mean age of 45.41\u2009\u00b1\u200920.26\u2009years.8 Generally, CDH is more com\u00ad mon in males and other studies support our finding.2 In con\u00ad trast, CDH in female adult has been documented.9\u201111 Fur\u00ad thermore, CDH are more on the left side due to protective effect of the liver and earlier closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal on the right diaphragm.9,10 In adults, it is diagnosed incidentally in radiological studies for other medical conditions.2,4,12 The patient could remain asymptomatic for years until the herniated abdom\u00ad Figure 4.

The CT scan is the gold standard and established the diagnosis of DH in 89% of cases.5,11 However, the diag\u00ad nosis could be made clinically, using chest radiographs, barium studies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).2, 5 Chest radiograph might show herniated abdominal vis\u00ad cera.2,10 A gastric air bubble in the chest cavity for herni\u00ad ated stomach or air-fluid level for pleural effusion.2,11 In our case, the chest radiograph indicated a large bowel in the left chest cavity while the CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of left diaphragmatic hernia, the herniated colon, and left pleural effusion.2,5 Several cases document that herniated abdominal viscera include the stomach, omentum, small and large bowel, appendix, mesentery, liver, gall bladder, kidney, spleen, and pancreas with the colon being the most common (52%).5,6,8\u201110,12 Surgery is the treatment of choice although a conserv\u00ad ative approach has been documented.5 Surgery via the ab\u00ad dominal approach is the most common approach for sur\u00ad gical repair, including thoracic or thoracoabdominal approaches.2,5,6 Surgery either via laparotomy (common\u00ad est), laparoscopic, or combined laparoscopic-thoracoscopic approach, thoracotomy.6,7 Also, a robotic-assisted ap\u00ad proach has been documented.5 Laparoscopic surgery bene\u00ad fits low complication rates and short hospital stay7 Opera\u00ad tive approach is influenced by the patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability, associated conditions, and the surgeon\u2019s exper\u00ad tise.6 Patients who present with features of incarceration, gangrene, or perforation of hernia content warrant emer\u00ad gency surgery.5,9 A laparotomy allows the surgeon to as\u00ad sess the viability of herniated contents, and manage ab\u00ad dominal visceral complications (gangrene, perforation, and contamination).5,9,10 On the contrary, it offers limited ac\u00ad cess to the chest cavity. Arguably the thoracoabdominal ap\u00ad proach enables evaluation and adequate surgical treatment of both cavities.5 The principles of surgery in DH are to identify the hernia defect, reduce the contents, and repair the diaphragm.6 In this case, we repaired the diaphragm with absorbable suture vicryl and did not place a mesh due to the significant conta\u00ad mination. Depending on the size of the defect, it can be pri\u00ad marily repaired with sutures (absorbable or non-absorbable 65%) or tension-free mesh absorbable or nonabsorbable mesh (68%).5,6,9,10 DH risks abdominal and thoracic complications includ\u00ad ing hydronephrosis, abscess formation, lung empyema, broncho-pleuro-colonic fistula, pleural effusion, fecotho\u00ad rax, and pneumonia5 Complications could be hernia-re\u00ad lated or surgery-related bowel ischemia, gangrene, bowel perforation, sepsis, and wound infection.2,5 In a systematic review of 193 patients with adult CDH, the 30-day mortal\u00ad ity was 4.4% while the postoperative complication rate was 21.5%.8 Gangrenous Colon in a Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia at 23 years: A Case Report East and Central African Journal of Surgery 7 Being a single retrospective case report limits its gen\u00ad eralizability. In addition, limited documentation on gan\u00ad grenous congenital diaphragmatic hernia in adults under\u00ad scores the need for more clinical studies. Conclusion Adult congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rare. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is vital and surgical repair is mandatory for strangulated diaphragmatic hernia. Laparotomy (ab\u00ad dominal approach) is preferred for emergency cases. Submitted: November 12, 2024 EAT. Accepted: February 28, 2025 EAT. Published: April 01, 2025 EAT.

Optimal management of PPSS is not fully defined though complete resection is generally considered a key component of treatment. Here we report the surgical approach to an unusual PPSS bridging the upper retroperitoneum and lower posterior mediastinum and discuss care in the context of the published literature. INTRODUCTION Synovial sarcomas (SS) account for almost 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas and typically arise in the para-articular re\u00ad gions, but actually has been shown to have no biologic or pathologic relationship to synovium. A subtype, primary pleural synovial sarcoma (PPSS),which is thought to arise from the pleura is idiopathic and extremely rare. PPSS is a locally aggressive tumor, seen most frequently in patients over age 40 years, compared to other SS which more com\u00ad monly occur in adolescents and young adults.1 The diagno\u00ad sis of PPSS is made after excluding metastasis from an ex\u00ad tra-thoracic site. We report the case of a patient who presented with a mass bridging the upper retroperitoneum and lower poste\u00ad rior mediastinum and involving the adjacent pleura. We dis\u00ad cuss the surgical approach and management of this unusual case within the context of the published literature. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publi\u00ad cation of this case report and accompanying images. CASE SUMMARY A 55-year-old female patient had repeated visits to an out\u00ad side hospital over six months with complaints of lower back pain and abdominal fullness. She denied dysphagia and weight loss. She had no other significant medical or sur\u00ad gical history. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a possible distal esophageal tumor. She was referred to our hospital for consideration of surgical resection. On physical examination, the patient was in no acute dis\u00ad tress, had normal vital signs and no appreciable abdominal mass or tenderness. Hematologic profile, electrolytes, liver, and renal function tests were normal. Contrast CT of the chest and upper abdomen revealed a 7 cm x 5.5 cm x 4.5 cm well circumscribed lower mediastinal and upper retroperi\u00ad toneal soft tissue mass with internal calcifications either ad\u00ad jacent to or arising from the distal esophagus (Figures 1a and 1b). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) was un\u00ad remarkable. Based on the clinical presentation, relatively indolent course and CT findings, the presumptive preoperative di\u00ad agnoses were paraganglioma or gastrointestinal stromal tu\u00ad This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

Following multidisciplinary discussions with our radiologists, percutaneous needle biopsy for diagnosis was not considered technically feasible. There is also no ac\u00ad cess currently to esophageal ultrasound guided biopsies at our hospital so it was decided to proceed directly to surgical exploration and resection. Surgical Approach After placing an epidural catheter, general anesthesia was induced and the patient was placed in the partial left lateral Figure 2a. Intraoperative findings at the beginning of the dissection. The gastroesophageal junction (solid black arrow) has been retracted to the patient\u2019s left, and the left lobe of the liver (black dotted arrow) to the patient\u2019s right, exposing the inferior vena cava and the hepatic veins. The diaphragm (blue block arrow) has been incised and retracted to expose the mediastinal component of the tumor. decubitus position (right side elevated approximately 30 de\u00ad grees), a right thoracoabdominal incision was made. The right 9th intercostal space was entered, the costal margin di\u00ad vided, and the incision extended in the midline of the upper abdomen to the level of the umbilicus. The right lung was deflated and the right pleural space entered. The diaphragm was incised parallel and close to the costal margin to access the peritoneal cavity. Thus there was adequate exposure of the gastroesophageal junction, hepatic veins, inferior vena cava and inferior aspect of the pulmonary hilum. Intraoperative findings The mass was well circumscribed with moderate peritu\u00ad moral fibrosis, and was located in the posterior medi\u00ad astinum and upper retroperitoneum with adhesion to the right crus of the diaphragm, and adhesion and leftward dis\u00ad placement of the distal thoracic and abdominal esophagus. It abutted the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava. There was no evidence of invasion of the esophagus, proximal stomach, liver, thoracic or lumbar vertebrae (Figures 2a and 2b). There were no intra-thoracic or peritoneal metastases. The right pleura was widely opened, the inferior pul\u00ad monary ligament divided, the lung retracted superiorly, and the diaphragmatic incision extended to expose the intra- ab\u00ad dominal component of the mass. The lower thoracic esoph\u00ad agus above the tumor was encircled and retracted towards Management of a Synovial Sarcoma at The Level of The Diaphragmatic Hiatus: A Case Report East and Central African Journal of Surgery 11 Figure 2b.

The incision was closed in the standard manner with interrupted non-ab\u00ad sorbable horizontal mattress sutures to reapproximate the diaphragm, and closure in layers of the thoracic and abdom\u00ad inal components of the incision. Pathology findings Grossly, the tumor measured 7x6x3cm, appeared solid and encapsulated (Figure 3a). Histologic examination (by hematoxylin and eosin staining) showed a high-grade sar\u00ad coma consistent with biphasic synovial sarcoma. Micro\u00ad scopic evaluation showed solid proliferation of plump spin\u00ad dle cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and variable sized nests of glands lined by columnar cells, some glands con\u00ad taining eosinophilic secretions with areas of necrosis and calcification (Figures 3b and 3c). Genomic testing was not available in our hospital (or elsewhere in Ethiopia) for fur\u00ad ther confirmation of the histologic diagnosis or the fusion subtype. Postoperative course The patient was admitted to the ICU for the first 24 hours, then transferred to the ward for routine postoperative care. She developed a superficial surgical site infection on third post-operative day and culture showed coagulase-negative staphylococcus. She was started on a 7-day course of ap\u00ad propriate antibiotics and local wet to dry wound care. Chest tube was removed after 5 days and the patient discharged Figure 3a. Gross appearance of the mass following fixation. It was well demarcated, mostly solid with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis (yellow arrow) Figure 3b.

Tumor histology was characterized nests of glands containing eosinophilic secretion (dark red arrow) and proliferating plump spindle cells (H&E, low power) home on the 11th post operative day with healing of the sur\u00ad gical site. On follow-up outpatient visits, the patient is re\u00ad Management of a Synovial Sarcoma at The Level of The Diaphragmatic Hiatus: A Case Report East and Central African Journal of Surgery 12 covering well 6 months post operatively and has recently completed treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy. DISCUSSION SS, a rare mesenchymal tumor, accounts for 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and generally arises in the extremities.1, 2 It is believed to originate from pluripotent mesenchymal tissue rather than the synovial cells because they occur in places where synovial structures do not exist and can show epithelial differentiation.3,4 Thus, the terminology of SS is a bit of a misnomer. Although we cannot be certain of the exact site of origin in our patient since the tumor involved the pleura, the mediastinum and upper retroperitoneum, it is probably most consistent with primary pleural SS (PPSS) which is an extremely rare tumor. The absence of extra-tho\u00ad racic disease should be confirmed before the diagnosis of PPSS is made since SS, like other soft tissue sarcomas, tend to metastasize to the pleura and lung.4\u20117 The clinical symptoms of PPSS vary widely, mainly based on the histology and region of the tumor occurrence, as well as the size and degree of tumor differentiation.8 Ini\u00ad tially, the patient may be asymptomatic but as the disease progresses, patients may present with non-specific pul\u00ad monary symptoms such as chest pain, cough, or dyspnea. In the current case, symptoms were predominantly abdom\u00ad inal due to the location of the tumor in the thoracoabdomi\u00ad nal junction. The radiologic manifestations of PPSS overlap with many other neoplasms in the lung and pleura,9 in\u00ad cluding primary and metastatic lung cancer, solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura and other rare parenchymal sarcomas (e.g., leiomyosarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and malig\u00ad nant fibrous histiocytoma).9\u201111 In the present case, paragan\u00ad glioma and primary esophageal tumor (i.e. leiomyoma or GIST) were the top diagnoses based on preoperative radio\u00ad logic findings and endoscopy. PPSS share the histologic, and immunohistochemical features of SS arising in other locations6,12 appearing as monophasic, biphasic, or poorly differentiated tumors. The two most common subtypes are monophasic spindle and biphasic.8 The unique fusion gene, SYT-SSX, generated by a specific chromosomal translocation t(x;18) (p11: q11) which fuses parts of chromosome 18 and the X chromo\u00ad some. This has been detected in more than 95% of SS and currently represents the most specific evidence for defin\u00ad itive diagnosis. Additionally, this chromosomal transloca\u00ad tion is now known to have two subtypes, commonly re\u00ad ferred to SSX1 and SSX2. The SSX1 fusion is known to have a higher proliferation rate and poorer clinical out\u00ad comes.13 Fusion gene detection is increasingly being con\u00ad sidered indispensable, with SS18 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) being favored in many labo\u00ad ratories.14,15 Unfortunately, we do not have access to ge\u00ad nomic testing at either our hospital or in Ethiopia. PPSS appears to be more aggressive than SS arising in extremities with most patients dying within 1\u20133 years.4,11, 16 Because of its rarity, the optimal treatment for PPSS re\u00ad mains unclear. Complete resection is considered the best option. Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and even neoadjuvant therapy have been used but again, due to the rarity of this tumor subset, definitive data are lack\u00ad ing.1,17 Repeat resections have been performed for local re\u00ad currence and sequenced resections are reported for cases in which the tumor could not be completely resected in a single operation.18 Fortunately, we were able to achieve a complete tumor resection in our patient but her follow-up is currently short and her prognosis uncertain. Longer follow- up with serial chest and abdominal CT imaging is essential. CONCLUSION PPSS is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that is difficult to con\u00ad firm based on imaging, but should be considered in the dif\u00ad ferential diagnosis of pleural based thoracic tumors without extra thoracic sites of disease or regional lymphadenopathy. The benefit of adjuvant therapy following complete resec\u00ad tion is uncertain but careful long-term follow-up is essential given the propensity of these tumors to recur.4,11,12,16 Conflict of interest All authors declare no conflicts of interest Informed consent We obtained verbal and written informed consent with local language (Amharic) from the patient for surgical interven\u00ad tion as well as willingness to be reported for publication.

There is little known about what type of surgical procedures are done in the district hospitals and which carder operates on what type of cases. Zambia formulated the national surgical, obstetrics, and anaesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) in 2017 which is a strategic plan aimed at improving surgical services in order to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Methods We conducted an analytical study on the surgical services available in the six major districts, across the province as we conducted surgical camps. We booked patients before the scheduled surgical camps through radio announcements and other established channels. We analyzed the local booking lists and theatre records, assessed the surgical services, accessibility and interviewed the local teams on the challenges being faced. Results There were no booking lists in all facilities. 68% of cases done in the district hospitals are caesarian sections with very few other surgical cases. We conducted 219 cases, 63% elective cases and 37% emergency cases of which 53% were obstetric cases. The majority of elective cases were excisions at 40% and hernias were 35%. The lack of human resource was the number one reason why basic surgical procedures were not being done followed by lack of supply of medical and surgical supplies. Conclusion There is very little surgery that happens in the district hospitals, apart from caesarian sections which exhaust the operating teams in the facilities. The lack of staff, medical equipment, and poor medical - surgical supplies are the top challenges advanced. There is a lot of work to be done as we thrive to achieve UHC in the Eastern region of Zambia. INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that Five billion people globally lack access to surgical care, result\u00ad ing in 18 million annual deaths and accounting for one-third of the global disease burden. In response, the WHO and its member states recognized surgical and anesthesia care as essential to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in 2015.1 The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) in\u00ad troduced the National Surgical, Obstetrics and Anesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) framework to guide countries in devel\u00ad oping strategic plans for surgical systems. This framework has supported several low and middle-income countries (Zambia included) in strengthening emergency and essen\u00ad tial surgical services as part of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) implementation.2 Defining essential surgical ser\u00ad vices is crucial for countries to provide comprehensive healthcare. NSOAPs play a vital role in integrating emer\u00ad gency and essential surgical care with other health services to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) goals.

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2025;30(1):15-20. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v30i1.4 bia was a pioneer in formulating NSOAPs in 2017, but implementation has been a significant challenge.3 Surgical care in Africa is predominantly centered in urban referral hospitals, leaving rural areas with limited access to quality surgical services. This disparity stems from a number of reasons including, Urban hospitals attract specialists due to better facilities, training opportunities, and living standards. Hospitals in cities have superior infrastructure, equipment, and resources. This has affected the rural hospitals nega\u00ad tively that it is difficulty to have access to essential surgi\u00ad cal care in these remote areas.4 In several countries, district hospital-level surgery is almost exclusively provided by non-physician clinicians (NPCs), also called clinical offi\u00ad cers, associate clinicians, or assistant medical officers. This is called \u2018task shifting\u2019.5 Compared to medical doctors, the duration of surgical training for NPCs is shorter (typically 2 to 3 years), with lower training costs and better reten\u00ad tion rates. The term task-shifting applies, which the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as \u2018the rational redis\u00ad tribution of tasks from highly qualified workers to health workers with shorter training and fewer qualifications\u2019.6 In the case of surgery, it involves the delegation of surgical tasks from surgical specialists or general medical doctors (MDs) to surgically trained NCPs. The contribution to sur\u00ad gical care by the NCPs is often considered as a substitute for medically qualified professionals and concerns around the safety of surgical \u2018task shifting\u2019 solutions have been expressed. Research by Gajewski et al. found that NCPs in rural hospitals achieved comparable patient outcomes to medically qualified professionals measured by wound in\u00ad fections and surgical mortality. This study addresses con\u00ad cerns about \u2018task shifting\u2019 safety, suggesting that NCPs can effectively bridge the surgical workforce gap in the rural ar\u00ad eas.7 It is known that even small facilities can deliver effec\u00ad tive basic essential surgical services with careful utilization of the existing healthcare delivery structures already in use that can be leveraged to provide affordable and quality sur\u00ad gical care.8 MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted surgical camps across six districts at their hospitals. The local teams were informed at least two months before camp time. The communities were informed through radio announcements, posters, and messengers to clinics. The clinic staff then were made to spread the invi\u00ad tations to their catchment areas through community-based volunteers to the specific Neighborhood Health Commit\u00ad tees (NHCs). The communities were asked to present them\u00ad selves to the local facilities with all kinds of surgical dis\u00ad eases on the specified surgical camp dates. Patients who presented earlier than the surgical camp dates were accord\u00ad ingly booked for the camps. All the camps had at least a Surgeon, a trainee Surgeon (or theatre nurse), and an anesthesia provider. The camps lasted on average five days with the daily work schedule of conducting ward rounds, outpatient screening, perform\u00ad ing surgical procedures with the local teams, attending to all emergencies and holding clinical meetings. We looked at the booking lists and operation records for one-month period. Key members of staff (theatre nurses, anesthesia providers, medical licentiates, and Doctors) were inter\u00ad viewed using a google sheet designed questionnaire. We picked August of 2021 to analyze the type of operations done in the facilities as most of the citizens in region are farmers and it is assumed that by August, most of them would have less commitment to fieldwork and they would easily seek medical attention. This was also before the an\u00ad nouncement of the surgical camps. All patients who were seen during the camps by the sur\u00ad gical teams were recorded. Patients found with surgical dis\u00ad eases and fit for theatre were booked. We noted those who denied consent due to different reasons and those we re\u00ad ferred for specialized investigations. RESULTS Analysis of records No facility had booking lists for elective operations apart from those booked for the camps. The analyzed records re\u00ad viewed a total of 299 operations done in the selected six hospitals. The majority of these operations were caesar\u00ad ian sections, at 68% followed by fracture manipulations at 13%. Hernia repairs were only done in one hospital, at 4% meanwhile exploratory laparotomies and excisions were both at 3%. See Figure 1. Surgical camps For our surgical camps, we screened 700 patients in total and operated on 219 different cases (Table 1). A majority of the patients (61%) operated on were over the age of 20 years (40% 20-39, 21% >40) with only 81 (39%) being <20. Those operated on were mostly males (57%) while females constituted 43%. Most cases for our camps were booked cases, about 65%. The majority of the emergency cases were obstetrics in nature (caesarian sections and post- abortal vacuum aspirations) at 53%. Of the elective cases, we had about 40% cases of inguinal hernia and 37% were lamps and bumps for excisions, Figures 2 and 3 have more details. Of note, 110 patients with clear surgical cases were not operated. Most of them did not show up (52%) due to their field/farm engagements or otherwise and 35% did not give consent while the rest (13%) were referred. A few were not operated due to a lack of basic investigations. Challenges of Providing Surgical Care in Eastern Zambia East and Central African Journal of Surgery 16 Figure 1.

Ten barriers to surgery were given, as outlined in Table 2. Exhausted oper\u00ad ating teams, unavailability of staff (Doctors and anesthesia providers), lack of surgical supplies and a lack of expertise were some of the most advanced challenges. DISCUSSION All anesthesia providers in the district hospitals are NCPs, mostly are former clinical officers or nurses. There is at least a medical licentiate (MLs) and medical officer (MO) at every facility. Not all theatres are run by trained theatre nurses. These are the cadres who do operations in the dis\u00ad trict hospitals with special emphasis on emergency obstetric cases. There are frequent refresher courses and mentorship programs for obstetric case management for these teams, but none of such programs are available for general surgical cases. Task shifting is very much being practiced but mostly on maternal and child health.9 Some facilities have no anesthesia providers and where available, it is only one provider per facility. The MOs and MLs have been made to give anesthesia in instances of unavailability of the anesthe\u00ad sia providers. This practice though risky, has been proven to be safe in resource limited settings.10 There is an imminent need to increase the numbers of all these cadres in the fa\u00ad cilities across the region and frequent mentorships on other surgical conditions are also needed to improve care.11 The district hospitals by and large do obstetric opera\u00ad tions, caesarian sections, and post abortal care, at 68%. As indicated by many authors12 and,13 obstetric emergencies are the main type of operations done in the District hospi\u00ad tals. The local teams are left exhausted by these cases and unable to go on with other surgical operations. During the study, fractures were the second leading emergency. In the Eastern province of Zambia, the simple fractures are man\u00ad Challenges of Providing Surgical Care in Eastern Zambia East and Central African Journal of Surgery 17 Figure 2. Elective Camp operations Figure 3. Emergency camp operations aged by physiotherapists and all other fractures are referred to the next level of care. All district hospitals refer emer\u00ad gency general surgical cases to referral hospitals. Exhaus\u00ad tion, inadequate supply of consumables and a lack of expe\u00ad rienced personnel are the major findings. With the district hospitals not doing elective operations patients with surgi\u00ad cal conditions worsen or complicate. For Example, hernias have ended up being referred as complicated cases to the next level of care. This becomes a huge cost on both the healthcare system and the patient. There are patients who have also suffered socio-economic injustice due to inacces\u00ad sibility of surgical care. For instance, the team operated on a man with a Hydrocele which had 2.7 liters of fluid, he was not able to socialize freely and was not economically pro\u00ad ductive for a long time. Lumps and bumps were the major\u00ad ity of elective cases we encountered but surprisingly, there were no records of these excisions being done in most hos\u00ad pitals. There are untold costs of referrals and morbidity plus mortality from these complicated cases that need to be as\u00ad sessed.

Challenges to Surgical care SN Challenges Frequency 1 Lack of surgical supplies 28 2 Lack of anesthesia drugs 19 3 Inadequate number of anesthesia providers 29 4 Unavailability of operating theatre nurses 12 5 Not enough Doctors 27 6 Lack of expertise 21 7 Exhausted operating team 31 8 Lack of ICU space 25 9 Not interested 1 10 No refresher courses 28 Among the poor staffing levels for the operating the\u00ad atres, anesthesia providers are the least in the province. Some hospitals have no provider such that the teams are forced to learn how to provide lifesaving anesthesia only and refer the rest.14 In hospitals where only a single person is tasked to give anesthesia, there are reports of exhaustion and referrals become the rescue. There is a need to increase the recruitment of more medical doctors and anesthesia providers as a matter of urgency to all DHs. This may border on policymakers and politicians understanding the scope of this demand15 as this will increase the chances of achieving UHC.16 The main source of income for most people in the region is farming. This makes it difficult for these patients to leave the farm work and visit a health facil\u00ad ity for most surgical diseases unless it is a debilitating con\u00ad dition. On the other hand, referral to the higher level of care is viewed costly as most of them cannot easily afford. The poor health seeking behavior is also in part due to poor ed\u00ad ucation levels and has led to delayed presentations and poor outcomes. It is important to mention also that access to clin\u00ad ics and hospitals is not easy. People have to move long dis\u00ad tances in order to find a facility. These reasons may have led to so many patients not showing up during the surgical camps. If it was possible, the best approach would be to op\u00ad erate on these patients immediately when they present with\u00ad out asking them to come back on an elective day because they are more likely not to show up. Poor infrastructure, in\u00ad consistent availability of medical and surgical supplies and in some cases, lack of surgical skills have also glossily at\u00ad tributed to poor surgical care in the province. Zambia needs to invest in UHC with a holistic approach as recommended in the NSOAPs guidelines to improve surgical outcomes.2 We propose basic surgical operations, such as excisions of lumps and bumps, Hernia repairs, hy\u00ad drocele surgeries, simple fracture management, amputa\u00ad tions, Incisions and drainage of abscesses, and some emer\u00ad gency laparotomies to be offered in the district hospitals. This will demand for improved staff posting, skill enhance\u00ad ment among the local teams, infrastructure development as well as a consistent supply of consumables. Some of the neglected surgical cases in rural hospitals are hernias, skin excisions, hydroceles, burn management, and approaches to different emergency surgical cases. Short courses, such as basic surgical skills, basic non-operative fracture man\u00ad agement, management of medical-surgical emergencies are highly recommended for all the critical health workers in rural hospitals. Surgical camps and mentorship programs can also help to support the local teams with clearing booked cases and transfer of skills. However, this may be more costly than the other methods. CONCLUSION There is very little surgery being done in rural hospitals, as obstetric emergency cases have taken over the over\u00ad stretched systems. The burden of surgery in rural commu\u00ad nities is huge and the load is increasing every day. There is a need to bridge the gap so that we can take surgery closer to the communities where access will be easier and reduce the cost on both the patient and the health care system. Recruitment of more health workers, consistent supply of consumables, improvement of infrastructure, and skill en\u00ad hancements will improve surgical outcomes.

Mini-cholecystectomy (MC) offers a viable alternative for gallstone management in similar settings. Objectives: This study assessed the safety, efficacy, and educational value of MC performed by consultants and trainee registrars in a resource-limited setting, evaluating clinical outcomes across different operator experience levels. Methods A single-blinded, prospective, descriptive, and analytical study was conducted in surgical facilities in Kassala State, Sudan, from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients undergoing MC for gallstone disease during this period were included. Data were collected on demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, hospital stay, postoperative outcomes, and pain management. Outcomes were compared between consultants and trainee registrars using the chi-square test, with significance set at P < 0.05. Results 600 patients underwent MC, with consultants performing 58% of procedures. The mean patient age was 43 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1:4.9. Hospital stay averaged 2.9 days, with registrars performing more surgeries in patients requiring longer stays (P < 0.0001). Postoperative vomiting was more common in registrar cases (P < 0.0001), and registrar patients reported slightly higher pain scores (P < 0.0001). Biliary injury occurred in three cases. Mini-cholecystectomy demonstrated safety and efficacy in the surgical training unit, with a low biliary injury rate (0.5%) and manageable postoperative pain (mean score of 5.4). It also proved a valuable training standard, as registrars performed 42% of procedures with acceptable outcomes. Conclusions Mini-cholecystectomy is a safe, effective, and accessible alternative to LC in LMICs. It also serves as a valuable training tool for surgical registrars. This study supports the expanded use of MC in resource-limited settings to improve access to gallstone management while providing effective training for surgical residents. Introduction Access to quality healthcare remains a critical issue in de\u00ad veloping low- and middle-income countries, where re\u00ad sources are limited, and there is limited data on healthcare standards and quality of care.

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2025;30(1):21-28. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v30i1.5 pediatric surgical care in Sudan, highlighting the need for further exploration in other surgical fields.1 Since a 1993 consensus conference established LC as the preferred treatment for gallstone disease, LC has be\u00ad come the standard of care globally due to its minimally invasive nature and reduced recovery time.2 However, in LMICs, limited access to advanced laparoscopic equipment and the high cost of such procedures make LC less accessi\u00ad ble. MC is a suitable alternative to LC, particularly in com\u00ad plex cases, such as acute cholecystitis, empyema, or gall\u00ad bladder mucocele. The operation is defined as a procedure for removing the gallbladder using a 3-6 cm incision in the right upper quadrant performed in the standard open surgi\u00ad cal setting. This procedure is associated with fewer compli\u00ad cations and a shorter postoperative recovery period in com\u00ad parison to regular open cholecystectomy, making it suitable for settings with limited resources3,4 The high cost of minimally invasive surgery in LMICs highlights the need for cost-effective, practical, and safe ap\u00ad proaches that can be adapted to resource constraints. MC offers a feasible alternative in such settings by providing safe and effective outcomes with lower resource demands, as shown in some studies.4\u20117 The objectives of this study were to determine if MC can serve as both an effective and safe treatment for gallstone disease and a sustainable train\u00ad ing standard adapted to the practical realities of the limited resources in Eastern Sudan. Patients and Methods This single-blinded, prospective descriptive, and analytical study was conducted in surgical health facilities in Kassala State, Sudan, from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients presenting with gallstone disease who underwent mini-cholecystectomy during this period were included, with no exclusion criteria. This approach allowed for a comprehensive, convenient sample of all eligible patients within the specified timeframe. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or their legal guardian be\u00ad fore the procedure, and all methods adhered to relevant reg\u00ad ulations and guidelines. The Ethics and Research Commit\u00ad tee of Kassala Police Hospital granted ethical approval. A control group of two consultants was compared to an in\u00ad dex group of eight trainee registrars who had completed specific training in mini-laparotomy cholecystectomy and could perform the procedure independently. Data were col\u00ad lected prospectively from patient records, directly observ\u00ad ing patient outcomes over a one-year follow-up period. Variables included operator role (consultant or registrar), patient demographics (age, gender, and comorbidities), di\u00ad agnosis, hospital stay duration, biliary injury incidence, postoperative vomiting, and pain management (analgesia and opioid use). Pain management protocols were standard\u00ad ized across both groups to ensure uniformity in postoper\u00ad ative care, and a Visual Analog Pain Scale was used to assess pain severity. Discharge Criteria were stable vital signs, pain control, oral intake, absence of complications, mobilization, normal urinary function, and understanding of postoperative care. To calculate the sample size, the sig\u00ad nificance level was set at 0.05 (5%), and power was set at 80% to detect a true difference. An appropriate formula was used using prior data. After calculations and adjustments, the total was set at 600 patients, allowing sufficient statisti\u00ad cal power to detect differences in the key outcomes across the two groups. All patients admitted within the study pe\u00ad riod were included to avoid selection bias. The relevant guidelines and regulations followed the rules and princi\u00ad ples of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 for medical re\u00ad search. All patients consented to participate in the study and publication of the results. All patient\u2019s data were analyzed anonymously to ensure confidentiality. Operative Procedure The procedure commenced with confirmation of diagnosis and acquisition of informed consent. Patients were posi\u00ad tioned supine on a bridging table, and general anesthesia was administered. The skin was prepped and draped for the aseptic technique. A right subcostal transverse incision was made through the abdominal wall down to the peritoneum. Deaver\u2019s retractor and bowel gauze were used for retrac\u00ad tion, with traction applied to the gallbladder fundus. Dissec\u00ad tion of Calot\u2019s triangle was performed, followed by ligation and division of both the cystic artery and cystic duct. The gallbladder bed was then dissected from the liver, and clo\u00ad sure was achieved in layers. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0, with statisti\u00ad cal significance set at P < 0.05 and a 95% confidence inter\u00ad val. Frequency distributions of variables were obtained, and cross-tabulations were conducted to compare results be\u00ad tween consultants and trainee registrars, with the chi-square test used to assess significance. Results A total of 600 patients underwent MC over the four-year study period. The study included two consultant surgeons and eight trainee registrars, with a ratio of 1:4. Consultants operated on 58% of the cases, which included initial demonstrations for registrars and handling more complex cases. The mean age of patients was 43 years (\u00b112.5 SD), ranging from 17 to 90. Notably, 14% (85 patients) were over 60, and registrars operated on 46.9% of these older pa\u00ad tients. The age distribution was significantly skewed to the right. The male-to-female ratio among patients was 1:4.9.

Among patients, 10.3% (62) had comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, bronchial asthma, or a history of acute coronary syndrome. Registrars operated on 42% of patients without comorbidities and 45% with comorbidities. However, this difference was not statis\u00ad tically significant. Regarding diagnosis, 49%(296) had symptomatic gall\u00ad stones, 42% (250) had chronic calculus cholecystitis, 8% (48) had acute calculus cholecystitis, and 1% (6) had empyema gallbladder. Registrars operated on these cases at similar rates to consultants, with a slightly higher rate of empyema (50%) and a lower rate of acute calculus chole\u00ad cystitis (37%), though these differences were statistically insignificant. The average hospital stay was 2.9 days (\u00b10.9 SD), ranging from 2 to 15 days, including the preoperative preparation day. Table 2 shows the relationship between hospital stay duration and the operator. The percentage of operations by registrars was highest in patients with a 4-day stay (61.2%), while the average across all lengths of stay was close to 42%. This correlation was statistically signif\u00ad icant (P < 0.0001). Biliary injury occurred in 3 patients (0.5% of total cases), all operated on by registrars. This complication rate was 1.2% among patients treated by reg\u00ad istrars and did not occur in patients treated by consultants (P = 0.042), as shown in Table 3. Pain levels were assessed on a 0-10 visual pain scale, with a mean score of 5.4 (\u00b11.2 SD). A small subset (3.7%) required no analgesia, while 2.2% re\u00ad quired injectable analgesia more than three times, and only 0.7% required opioids. Registrars primarily operated on pa\u00ad tients with pain scores of 6 or higher, and this correlation was significant (P < 0.0001), as shown in Figure 1. The number of retractors used was also analyzed for their effect on pain, showing no significant impact on pain scores de\u00ad spite variation from 1 to 3 retractors (P < 0.0001). Postop\u00ad erative vomiting occurred in 38% of patients, with a 2.1:1 ratio favoring a higher incidence in patients operated on by registrars compared to consultants (68% vs. 32%). This cor\u00ad relation was statistically significant (P < 0.0001), as shown in Figure 2. Vomiting generally lasted 1-2 days postopera\u00ad tively. Discussion This study underscores MC as a feasible and effective sur\u00ad gical option for gallstone disease in resource-limited set\u00ad tings. Given the challenges of adopting LC in LMICs due to the cost and availability of specialized equipment, MC of\u00ad fers a cost-effective, accessible alternative that still enables good clinical outcomes. Our findings align with research showing MC\u2019s role as a suitable alternative where resource constraints limit access to LC, particularly in settings simi\u00ad lar to ours in Eastern Sudan.4 One of the key insights from our study is the operative role distribution between con\u00ad sultants and registrars. Consultants performed 58% of the procedures, indicating their involvement in demonstrating techniques and managing more complex cases. This struc\u00ad tured engagement of consultants supports registrars\u2019 train\u00ad ing and allows MC to serve as an effective educational tool in surgical training. The association between the op\u00ad erators and various clinical outcomes is noteworthy, par\u00ad ticularly with statistically significant differences in patient gender and hospital stay duration. In our study, registrars performed surgeries in 46.9% of patients over 60, suggest\u00ad ing that MC can be adapted as a training procedure in this demographic with favorable outcomes. Additionally, this study affirms the feasibility and safety of the mini-chole\u00ad Mini-cholecystectomy, A Standard of Care and Training in Limited Resource Health Facilities: An Example \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 23 Table 2.

Mini-cholecystectomy, A Standard of Care and Training in Limited Resource Health Facilities: An Example \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 24 cystectomy as a treatment modality and training model in surgery, which aligns with previous studies.8,9 Our patient cohort, with a mean age of 43 years, in\u00ad cluded a substantial portion of older adults (14% were over 60), suggesting that MC can be effectively performed in el\u00ad derly patients, even by registrars, after adequate training. This finding aligns with previous studies reporting MC\u2019s utility in elderly or high-risk populations due to its rela\u00ad tively straightforward technique, shorter operative times, and reduced anesthetic exposure, which may be advanta\u00ad geous for elderly patients.5,10\u201112 The analysis of postoperative pain revealed significant differences related to the operator. Patients operated on by registrars reported higher pain levels, with a mean visual pain score of 5.4 (\u00b11.2 SD) and a significant correlation be\u00ad tween pain intensity and the registrar group (P < 0.0001). This discrepancy may be attributed to variations in techni\u00ad cal proficiency, as surgical skill often improves with expe\u00ad rience. However, overall pain outcomes remain consistent with studies indicating that MC provides low postoperative pain intensity comparable to LC.13,14 The minimal need for analgesics, with only 2.2% requiring injectable analgesia more than three times, highlights the feasibility of MC as a minimally invasive technique regarding pain management. Hospital stay duration was also significantly associated with the operator, with the mean stay at 2.9 days (\u00b10.9 SD). The duration of hospital stays ranged from 2 to 15 days, and registrars tended to operate on patients requiring extended hospital stays, particularly those staying 4 days (61.2% of these cases). This correlation was statistically significant (P < 0.0001), suggesting a learning curve in postoperative management. Nevertheless, MC has shown comparable re\u00ad covery times to LC in other studies, supporting its efficacy in reducing hospital stays in LMICs.15\u201118 Biliary injury is the most feared complication in chole\u00ad cystectomy procedures; it is a key measure of surgical safety, occurring in only 0.5% of cases (3 patients), exclu\u00ad sively in surgeries performed by registrars. This rate of bil\u00ad iary injury (1.2% for registrars) underscores the potential learning curve in MC but remains low, aligning with find\u00ad ings that MC and LC both have rare occurrences of biliary injury with adequate supervised training.4 Importantly, no biliary injuries were reported in consultant-led surgeries (P = 0.042), reinforcing the importance of structured surgical training and experienced oversight in minimizing compli\u00ad cations. The study also explored postoperative vomiting, a sig\u00ad nificant finding with a higher incidence in patients operated on by registrars (68% vs. 32% for consultants; P < 0.0001). This could be attributed to subtle technical differences, though it did not affect overall outcomes. With its straight\u00ad forward approach, MC enables registrars to develop fun\u00ad damental surgical skills, which previous studies affirm by showing low complication rates comparable to those in LC.18 Nevertheless, this aspect highlights the need to con\u00ad tinuously evaluate surgical techniques to minimize adverse effects, particularly in training environments. In a training unit, the trainees are expected to tend to operate in less com\u00ad plex cases. , The study determined the complexity of cases based on preoperative clinical assessment and ultrasound findings. Clinically, complex cases included patients with recurrent biliary colic, prolonged symptoms, a history of acute cholecystitis, or a previous abdominal procedure. Ul\u00ad trasound criteria included a thickened gallbladder wall (>4 mm), pericholecystic fluid, contracted gallbladder, or im\u00ad pacted stones in the neck or cystic duct. Urgency is often complex, as it is acute calculus cholecystitis or empyema. This study\u2019s findings affirm that MC offers a compa\u00ad rable and often lower-cost alternative to LC, as previous studies have shown that MC reduces the need for special\u00ad ized equipment and can reduce hospitalization costs due to shorter operative times and fewer postoperative require\u00ad ments. This cost-effectiveness is particularly beneficial in LMICs, where healthcare budgets are constrained, and equipment limitations prevail.19\u201121 The overall cost savings associated with MC support its growing role as a practical alternative to LC, especially for routine cholecystectomies, as no complex, expensive surgical set-up is essential.22 Recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of mini- laparotomy and mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy as al\u00ad ternatives to traditional open and multi-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy, particularly in challenging cases or re\u00ad source-limited settings. In Sudan, a 512-case study demon\u00ad strated the feasibility of mini-laparotomy cholecystectomy, achieving low complication rates and short hospital stays, proving it to be a safe and cost-effective option in resource- constrained environments.23 Another study compared la\u00ad paroscopic subtotal cholecystectomy (LSTC) with open to\u00ad tal cholecystectomy (OTC) in patients with difficult gallbladders, showing that LSTC had advantages such as reduced blood loss, shorter operative times, and a lower risk of bile duct injuries, making it a safer choice for complex gallbladder cases.24 Mini-cholecystectomy has been shown to decrease postoperative pain, enhance cosmetic outcomes, and accelerate recovery, although it requires more experi\u00ad ence to overcome visibility challenges in complex cases.25 In evaluating MC, it\u2019s critical to consider patient-specific factors that impact the incidence of complications. Vari\u00ad ables like acute cholecystitis, anatomical anomalies, and previous abdominal surgeries can significantly impact sur\u00ad gical outcomes, irrespective of the operating surgeon\u2019s ex\u00ad perience. A comprehensive evaluation that accounts for these factors is crucial to accurately attribute the causes of such complications. This applies to the biliary injuries that occurred exclusively in the registrar-performed group, which may suggest a difference in outcomes between con\u00ad sultants and registrars. Although there were only three in\u00ad juries in a sample of 600 patients, the sample size may be insufficient to detect a significant difference between the two groups. This may require a larger sample size to ensure that the observed difference is not due to random variation but represents a true disparity in surgical outcomes.26,27 Mini-cholecystectomy, A Standard of Care and Training in Limited Resource Health Facilities: An Example \u2026 East and Central African Journal of Surgery 25 Studies comparing MC and LC have given mixed re\u00ad sults. Some research indicates that LC offers benefits of reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and quicker return to regular activities. However, other studies suggest that MC may have advantages such as shorter oper\u00ad ative times and lower costs.[28.29] The results of mini-laparotomy approaches offer sig\u00ad nificant benefits for patients with complicated gallstone disease, offering suitable, safe alternatives to conventional open cholecystectomy. Our study showed the same good outcomes with the additional value of presenting a surgical training model. Conclusions Mini-cholecystectomy (MC) is a safe, effective, and feasi\u00ad ble surgical option for gallstone disease in a resource-lim\u00ad ited setting in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The procedure is simple and achieves favorable patient out\u00ad comes, including acceptable levels of postoperative pain, short hospital stays, and low complication rates. It also serves as an effective training tool in surgical education programs, where access to advanced laparoscopic equip\u00ad ment may be limited. Study Strengths In this study, patient selection bias was avoided by includ\u00ad ing all eligible patients. Direct observation and supervision of the outcomes enhance data reliability. As a training stan\u00ad dard, the comparison between consultants and trainees will provide more insights into its suitability. Moreover, ethical approval and consent for participation and publication en\u00ad hance the article\u2019s credibility. Weaknesses and Limitations The weak points are that it\u2019s a single-center study, on the registrar group, there are many operators, and the follow- up was limited to one year, which may overlook long-term complications. Additionally, the low incidence of bile duct injury may indicate the need for a bigger sample size to ac\u00ad curately evaluate this complication. There was no real ran\u00ad domization of the cases between consultant and registrar groups, which may include selection bias of cases. Recommendations 1. Conduct multicenteric randomized studies with big\u00ad ger sample sizes and longer follow-ups for validation of the results. 2. Enhance the training programs in LMICs and make MC a viable option when access to laparoscopic ser\u00ad vices is limited. Submitted: January 14, 2025 EAT. Accepted: March 07, 2025 EAT.

Abstract Background: Surgical androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to treat advanced prostate cancer can be achieved either by bilat- eral total orchidectomy (BTO) or bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy (BSCO). However, biochemical and clinical equivalence between BTO and BSCO among native Africans is undocumented. Objective: To compare the biochemical response (testosterone and prostate specific antigen) in patients who had BTO and BSCO for advanced prostate cancer. Methods: A randomized single- blind study of 64 consenting patients that underwent either BTO or BSCO. Pre- and post-op- erative PSA and testosterone assays were done serially at intervals and compared between each treatment group. Results: Each treatment group were similar with no statistically significant difference in terms of age (p= 0.449) or degree of tumor differentiation (p =0.714). Neither median testosterone (p= 0.515) nor the mean pre-operative PSA differ between the two groups (p = 0.482). Also, similar trends were noticed post operatively except at the 2nd month when a statistically significant difference was recorded (p = 0.003). Conclusion: The two techniques of orchidectomy were effective in accomplishing androgen deprivation. They produced similar biochemical (testosterone and PSA) response. Keywords: androgen deprivation therapy; subcapsular orchidectomy; total orchidectomy.

In a more recent communi- ty-based screening in Nigeria, high prevalence was ob- served with majority already had advanced disease at the time of diagnosis2. In many of the studies in Nigeria, late presentation with an advanced stage of the disease was the norm3\u20137. Due to the late presentation, treatment has been essentially pal- liative with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) aimed at achieving castrate testosterone levels; i.e., (testosterone level of less than 50ng/dl or less than 5% of serum tes- tosterone before castration)8,9. Androgen deprivation can be achieved either surgically (by a bilateral orchidectomy) or by medical therapy with (Luteinizing Hormone Releas- ing Hormone (LHRH) analogs/antagonists, anti-andro- gens, or oestrogens). Bilateral total orchidectomy (BTO), which involves total excision of the testes and epididy- mis, has been found to achieve castrate testosterone levels within 24 hours10. It is a one-time treatment and the least expensive with comparable efficacy to other modalities of treatment10,11. Despite this, most patients especially in developed countries, when given a choice prefer medical androgen ablation due to psychological effect of an emp- ty scrotum and poor body image12,13. Riba in 1942 described the technique of bilateral sub- capsular orchidectomy (BSCO), which entails leaving the tunica albuginea and epididymis in the scrotum 14. This \u00a9 2023 Arogundade AK et al.

However, Mc- Donald and Calams in 1959 showed that the tunica al- buginea and epididymis when retained in a sub-capsular orchidectomy have Leydig-like cells which continue to produce testosterone thereby precluding complete an- drogen ablation at the testicular level 15. Also, O\u2019Conor et al, in 1963 showed that human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation in patients, who have undergone sub-capsu- lar orchidectomy, produced an increase in urinary excre- tion of testosterone metabolic product (androsterone) 16. These studies questioned the efficacy of BSCO; thus, BTO was promoted as the treatment of choice 17. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in BSCO as a treatment option in advanced prostate cancer because of the observed persistent oncological effectiveness, and better psychological outcomes 18. Furthermore, some studies have also found significantly fewer post-operative complications with BSCO than BTO 13,19. Demonstration of the biochemical response to either type of bilateral orchidectomy in native Africans are rath- er scanty in indexed publications. Furthermore, prostate cancer has a heterogeneous tumor presentation coupled with the significant racial differences in the incidence, prevalence, biologic behavior, stage at presentation and mortality 2,20. These warrants evaluating therapeutic op- tions available to patients in real world settings 4,21,23. Thus, we sought to compare the efficacy of the two types of orchidectomy in terms of biochemical response in pa- tients of African descent in our country. Methods A prospective, single blind randomized and comparative hospital-based study among all consecutive advanced prostate cancer patients presenting to the Urology Divi- sion of a tertiary hospital, North Central, Nigeria over a period of 12months. Sample Size Estimation Sample size was determined with the formula: n= [A+B] 2 \u00d72 \u00d7 SD2 / DIFF2 where n= the sample size required in each group (double this for total sample); SD= stan- dard deviation of primary outcome variable from previ- ous study; DIFF= size of difference of clinical impor- tance; A= significance level; B= documented mean power of 80% from previous study Values were deduced from a previous local study by Magoha (24), who assessed sub- capsular orchidectomy in management of prostate cancer in Nigerians. Hence, n= [1.96+0.84]2 \u00d72\u00d7212/14.62 = 32.4 approx- imately 32 patients and the total sample size was 2n=64 patients. Inclusion Criterion Consenting patients with diagnosis of advanced pros- tate cancer that chose bilateral orchidectomy as mode of treatment. Exclusion Criteria Patients excluded were those other histo-pathological types of prostate cancer, patients on neo-adjuvant hor- monal therapy during the study period, patients with de- bilitating co- morbidities and patients with synchronous tumors. Ethical consideration Ethical clearance was obtained from the hospital Ethical Review Committee (ERC) for a period of one-year. In- formed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study. Patient refusal to participate or desire to withdraw participation at any stage of the study was re- spected without attempt at coercion or inducement. Strict confidentiality was adhered to in the management of pa- tient records, results and details. Patient selection and randomization The patients recruited for the study were randomized to either of the two procedures designated as A and B in equal numbers using block randomization to limit bias and achieve even distribution between the treatment arms. Group A patients had bilateral sub-capsular or- chidectomy (BSCO) while Group B patients had bilateral total orchidectomy (BTO). A block size of four (4) was used because of the esti- mated sample size and the need to achieve an even bal- ance between the groups. Each block contained an even number of four (4) procedures equally distributed but in different order; i.e., by random permutation. The recruitment of patients for the study ended after at- taining the estimated sample size. African Health Sciences, Vol 23 Issue 1, March, 2023 484 Peri-operative Assessment All recruited patients had thorough clinical evaluation from the onset with detailed history and physical exam- ination followed by appropriate pre-operative investiga- tions such as complete blood count, fasting serum glu- cose and renal function test. Surgical Procedure Procedures were carried out in supine position after ad- ministering pre-incision testicular nerve block (spermatic cord) with 1% lidocaine. This entails palpating and pick- ing the spermatic cord between the thumb and index fin- ger about 1cm infero-medial to the ipsilateral pubic tu- bercle. A fine needle (size 23G) was used to inject the 1% lidocaine to the overlying skin (wheal) and then further down into the cord. Care was taken to aspirate each time before injecting anaesthetic agent to avoid intravascular delivery. The proposed line of skin incision was also in- filtrated with 1% lidocaine. These procedures were per- formed by the lead surgeon and trained senior registrars in Urology Division. Subcapsular Orchidectomy 25: A longitudinal median raphe scrotal incision was made after grasping the scro- tum behind the testes to tense the overlying skin. The in- cision was deepened through the dartos muscle and cre- masteric layers in each hemi-scrotum down to the tunica vaginalis. Each testis was delivered into the wound after opening the tunica vaginalis. The tunica albuginea was in- cised along the entire length of the anterior border and a piece of gauze used in sweeping out the testicular tissue from the edges to the center. A 3/0 vicryl suture was used to ligate the scooped tissue at the hilus before excision. The inner surface of the tunica albuginea as well as the base was fulgurated to destroy residual interstitial cells, and to control bleeding. Repair of the tunica albuginea was done with continuous 2/0 vicryl suture. Cauterization of bleeders in the dartos was done before closure with continuous 3/0 vicryl suture. Skin closure was achieved with 3/0 nylon vertical mattress sutures. Scrotal dressing was firmly applied and left in situ for 48hrs before release and wound inspection. Total Orchidectomy 25: Median raphe scrotal skin inci- sion was made to deliver the testis into the wound from each hemi-scrotum and to expose the epididymis and the cord. The vas deferens was bluntly dissected from the spermatic vessels to ligate separately due to its blood sup- ply. It was double clamped proximally and single clamped distally before dividing. It is doubly ligated with 3/0 vic- ryl suture. The rest of the cord was separated into two or three parts, doubly clamped, divided between clamps and ligated distally and proximally with 3/0vicryl. Cau- terization of bleeders in the dartos was done before clo- sure with continuous 3/0 vicryl suture. Skin closure was achieved with 3/0 nylon vertical mattress sutures and scrotal dressing firmly applied for 48hrs before release of pressure scrotal dressing. Data collection and analysis A structured proforma was use to collect socio-demo- graphic data, Gleason\u2019s score, testosterone and prostate specific antigen (PSA) for each patient. Blood samples for testosterone and PSA for biochemical assays were first drawn on the morning of surgery and ended at the third month of follow-up. The data obtained were analysed using Statistical Pack- age for Social Science \u201cIBM SPSS version 20.0\u201d Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Mean and range were determined for variables with normal distribution while median and in- terquartile ranges were determined for non- parametric variables. The pre-operative and post \u2013operative tes- tosterone and PSA values were compared between and within the groups using Mann-Whitney-U test and paired sample t-test respectively based on the socio-demograph- ics and Gleason\u2019s score using Chi square. The results were displayed using tables and graph. For all statistical tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results Sixty-four patients were recruited for the study (32 pa- tients in each group). Mean age was 70.84\u00b18.18years with a range of 49 to 90 years and the. majority of the subjects (93.8%) were married (Table 1). Comparison of the socio-demographic characteristics of the two study groups is as shown in Table 2.0. Mean age in BTO and BSCO groups were 71.63 \u00b1 7.56 years and 70.06 \u00b1 8.79 years respectively (p = 0.449). The mean Gleason\u2019s score of all subjects was 7.38 (\u00b11.35) with a range of 4 to 9. The Gleason score of the tumor differentiation revealed that 50.0% were poorly differentiated (\u22658), 29.7% were moderately differentiated (7) and 20.3% were well differ- entiated (\u22646). The mean Gleason\u2019s score was 7.44\u00b11.41 vs. 7.31\u00b11.31 in the BTO and BSCO group respectively (p =0.714). African Health Sciences, Vol 23 Issue 1, March, 2023 485 The median testosterone level of all subjects pre-oper- atively was 475ng/dl. The lowest testosterone value of 27ng/dl was recorded at 48hours post operatively, though castrate level (<50ng/dl) was already attained at 6hours post operatively. The mean pre-operative level of serum PSA among the 64 subjects was 59.82 \u00b1 29.22ng/ml.

African Health Sciences, Vol 23 Issue 1, March, 2023 488 Discussion The two group of treatment were comparable in terms of age (p = 0.449) and degree of differentiation of the ade- nocarcinoma (p =0.714). This represents a better match compared to a previous study by Zhang et al 13, in which the BSCO group had more poorly differentiated tumors. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) values which are useful in assessing prostate cancer were assessed pre- and post-or- chidectomy serially. The mean pre- operative serum PSA value of 59.82\u00b129.22 ng/ml using ELISA technique ob- served among the subjects. This value was beyond the expected value of <4ng/ml in healthy adult. However, this does not foreclose the fact that low serum PSA have been associated with non-palpable but clinically signifi- cant prostate cancer and high Gleason score 27,28. Comparison of the pre-operative serum PSA values be- tween the BTO and BSCO group yielded mean values of 62.41ng/ml and 57.23ng/ml respectively. The difference observed was not statistically significant and was in keep- ing with the extent of tumour differentiation as demon- strated by the mean Gleason\u2019s score of 7.44 and 7.31 for BTO and BSCO respectively. This high value of serum PSA in recruited patients was also noticed by Magoha in Nairobi 29 where 92% of patients with advanced prostate cancer had PSA >20ng/ml. Following orchidectomy (all 64 subjects), a significant drop in serum PSA was observed till the 2nd month when mean value of 20.59\u00b118.96ng/ml was recorded. This was followed by a slight rise in mean value to 23.06\u00b122.48ng/ ml in the third month. This sharp drop in serum PSA was more pronounced with the BSCO group in the 2nd month (p=0.003). However, the trend was not sustained into the 3rd month. On the contrary, a gradual but con- sistent decline of serum PSA was observed for BTO group throughout the course of measurement. It can be inferred that the slight rise in serum PSA (all 64 subjects) noticed in the 3rd month was contributed by those pa- tients that had BSCO. The role of serum PSA as a biomarker for prostate can- cer diagnosis, prognosis, treatment monitoring as well as survival evaluation is well established 30\u201332; thus, the de- cline in PSA noted in this study was expected after or- chidectomy due to loss of androgen trophism 33. How- ever, the extent of decline and interval it takes to get to the nadir level was variable 32, depending on the death of differentiated neoplastic cells and/or decrease in expres- sion of androgen receptor (AR) stimulated PSA in sur- viving tumour cells 30,34. It may be pre-mature to conclude that the PSA nadir in index study was attained at the 2nd month after surgery or that the slight rise noticed in the 3rd month was evidence of biochemical progression due to relatively short period of follow-up when compared to similar study with mean/median follow-up period of 28months and 35months 13,18. Albeit, it is common to find patients with advanced prostate cancer who under- go ADT having serum PSA nadir level of \u2264 4ng/ml at 6/7months post- surgery 30,32,33. This difference in pattern in relation to the BSCO group may be attributed to the heterogenous nature of prostate cancer clones of cells. These cells demonstrate variable degree of response to loss of androgen stimulus 20. However, this comparative difference was not reported in previous studies 13,18 and may require a larger randomized clinical trial to validate. The second biochemical parameter studied was serum testosterone whose median pre- operative value deter- mined using ELISA was 475ng/dl (all 64 subjects). This pre-castrate value falls within the range expected for nor- mal males 35. This was comparable to values obtained in previous studies 35\u201338 and did not differ between the two groups(p=0.515). The post-operative serum testosterone median values measured serially from 0 hour (immediately after removal of the testes) showed an initial steep decline from 475mg/dl to125mg/dl. This rapid drop excludes the possibility of surgical maneuver causing a temporary spike in the serum level testosterone. Similar precipitous decline was noted by Arcadi39 in fivof the six patients that had sub- capsular orchidectomy with serial monitoring of serum testosterone values. The post-operative chang- es based on surgical technique employed revealed that at 0 hour (i.e, immediately after orchidectomy), there was an approximately 74% decline in the pre-operative serum testosterone to produce median values of 189.5ng/dl and 11.5ng/dl for BTO and BSCO respectively. Similar trend was observed in successive measurements done at vari- able interval over the initial 48hours post-orchidectomy and at the 3rd month of follow-up. There was no signifi- cant difference but a near perfect alignment from the 3rd hour after surgery to the 3rd month of follow-up was observed. Attaining castrate testosterone level is the aim of ADT and this level is defined as <50ng/dl or <5% of pre-cas- trate level though a stricter definition puts it at <20ng/ African Health Sciences, Vol 23 Issue 1, March, 2023 489 ml 8,38. Analysis based on the technique of surgery showed that patients randomized into BTO and BSCO all attained the castrate serum testosterone level at 6hours post orchidectomy with median values of 41.0ngdl and 41.5ng/dl respectively(p=0.973). It can be inferred that both surgical procedures attained similar levels of hor- monal ablation. The lowest median testosterone value was at 48hours post-surgery(27.0ng/dl) but subsequently rose to 36.0ng/ dl at the 3rd month of follow-up. This rise may be due to extra-testicular sources of androgens, especially, since the patients were not on maximal androgen blockade. The rise in median serum testosterone level may also be contributory to the increase in serum PSA value at the 3rd month after surgery. Specifically, at the 3rd month of follow-up, the median serum testosterone level was 31.5ng/dl and 42.0ng/dl for BTO and BSCO respective- ly. In absolute terms, these values represent a rise from the measurement at 48hours post-orchidectomy, with a higher percentage increase recorded in the BSCO group. Comparatively however, these changes were statistically not significant and as such cannot be conclusively impli- cated in the rise in mean serum PSA observed in the 3rd month of follow-up among subjects that had BSCO. Furthermore, the linear graph comparison between the groups showed a near perfect alignment from the 3rd hour post-surgery till the 3rd month post orchidectomy and there was no significant difference in the recorded values throughout the course of measurement. This find- ing corroborates earlier studies 17,36,37 that disputed the possibility of persistence of \u2018residual Leydig like cells\u2019 in patients that had BSCO as claimed by O\u2019Conor et al 16. Future research The goal of treating patients with advanced prostate can- cer is palliative and this is to maintain as best possible patients\u2019 quality of life and psychological well-being. That can include the cosmetic appeal of their scrotum post-sur- gery. Therefore, beyond the biochemical and clinical ef- ficacy of two methods of surgical androgen deprivation, it is important to assess the psychological impact of each procedure on the patients within a randomized trial. Conclusion This study observed that both procedures were effective in androgen deprivation with regards to attainment of castrate testosterone level and decline in the post-opera- tive serum PSA. In comparing the two procedures by out- comes, the study showed that the biochemical responses to BTO and BSCO were similar and comparable. References 1. Ogunbiyi JO, Shittu OB.

Objective: This study evaluates the treatment outcomes of prostate cancer patients at Sohag University Hospital from 2017 to 2021. Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 49 prostate cancer patients. Data on demographics, cancer staging, Gleason scores, treatment modalities, and outcomes were analyzed. Results: The mean age of patients was 70.51 years. A significant proportion (53.1%) were diagnosed with high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer, and 42.9% had metastatic cancer. ADT was administered to 95.9% of patients, and 38.8% received radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) rates were 100% at 1 year, 88.9% at 3 years, and 66.7% at 5 years. The duration of hormonal treatment significantly impacted OS, while no significant differences were noted across age, T stage, and Gleason score subgroups. Conclusions: The study highlights the severity of treated prostate cancer cases and the high overall survival rates. The duration of hormonal treatment was a significant factor in overall survival, emphasizing the importance of treatment duration management. Keywords: Prostate cancer, Androgen deprivation therapy, Radiotherapy, Survival rate, Gleason score, Hormonal treatment. INTRODUCTION Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer- related death among men worldwide. Its treatment outcomes have been extensively studied, with numerous research articles examining various aspects of different treatment modalities. Radical prostatectomy, a common surgical treatment for localized prostate cancer, has been shown to significantly reduce mortality compared to conservative management. However, surgery is also associated with potential adverse effects, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction (1). Radiation therapy, including external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy, is another primary treatment option. Studies have demonstrated that EBRT combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves overall survival in high-risk patients (2). Brachytherapy, involving the implantation of radioactive seeds, has been reported to have favorable long-term biochemical control rates, especially in low- to intermediate-risk patients (3). Hormone therapy, or ADT, is commonly used for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. While ADT can effectively control disease progression and alleviate symptoms, it is often associated with significant side effects, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular issues, and metabolic changes (4). Recent advancements in hormone therapy, including the use of newer agents like abiraterone and enzalutamide, have shown promising results in improving survival and quality of life in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (5). Active surveillance is an option for men with low- risk prostate cancer, aiming to monitor the disease closely and intervene only if there is evidence of progression. This approach can help avoid or delay the side effects associated with more aggressive treatments. Studies have indicated that active surveillance is a safe and effective strategy for appropriately selected patients, with favorable long-term outcomes (6). The choice of treatment for prostate cancer depends on various factors, including disease stage, patient health, and preferences. Each treatment modality has its benefits and risks, and ongoing research continues to refine these strategies to optimize outcomes for prostate cancer patients (7). This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of different treatment strategies for prostate cancer, including surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and active surveillance. By analyzing survival rates, recurrence rates, and quality of life measures, this research sought to provide a comprehensive overview of the efficacy and safety of these treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study employed a retrospective cohort design to analyze the outcomes of prostate cancer treatments of patients diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer at the Oncology Department of Sohag University Hospital from January 2017 to January 2021. https://ejhm.journals.ekb.eg/ 2508 Inclusion Criteria Patients were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: \uf0b7 Aged 18 years or older. \uf0b7 Diagnosed with any stage or grade of prostate cancer. \uf0b7 Histologically confirmed epithelial type of prostate cancer. Exclusion Criteria Patients were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: \uf0b7 Aged below 18 years. \uf0b7 Diagnosed with other malignancies. Treatment Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measures: \uf0b7 Overall Survival (OS): Defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the last date the patient was seen. \uf0b7 Progression-Free Survival (PFS): Defined as the length of time during and after treatment that the patient lives with the disease without it worsening, particularly important in the metastatic setting. \uf0b7 Disease-Free Survival (DFS): Defined as the time from the end of treatment to the date of the first relapse. Secondary Outcome Measures: \uf0b7 Early and Late Treatment Toxicities: Adverse effects experienced by patients during and after treatment. Data Collection Patient data were extracted from electronic health records. Collected data included demographics (age, race), prostate cancer staging (T stage), Gleason score, type of treatment received (androgen deprivation therapy, radiotherapy, surgery), duration of treatment, and follow- up data. Additional data collected included prostate- specific antigen levels, presence of metastases, and comorbidities. Ethical Considerations The privacy of patient data was strictly maintained. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Sohag University Hospital. The Helsinki Declaration was followed throughout the study's conduct. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software version 25.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2017. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Qualitative data were described using frequencies and percentages. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to verify the normality of distribution. Quantitative data were described using the range (minimum and maximum), mean, standard deviation, and median. Statistical significance was judged at the 5% level. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to assess OS and PFS, and the Log-Rank test was used to compare survival distributions between groups. RESULTS The ages of the patients ranged from 49 to 88 years, with a mean age of diagnosis in our cohort was 70.51 \u00b1 8.40 years with a range from 49 to 88 years. The majority of the patients (89.8%) were over 60 years old, and 67.3% resided in rural areas. The majority of patients (53.1%) were diagnosed with high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer, while 42.9% had metastatic prostate cancer to the bone, and 4.1% had intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Radiological findings from MRI or CT scans before intervention are detailed in table 1. Significant findings included moderate to marked prostate enlargement in 98% of patients, indentation or infiltration into nearby structures in 22.4%, and the presence of metastases in 38.8%.

Regarding the outcomes of the studied patients, biochemical failure, indicated by rising PSA levels, was observed in 28.6% of cases. Three patients (6.1%) died due to cancer, while the remaining 93.9% were alive at the end of the study. Our study examined the correlation between overall survival and factors such as age, treatment modalities, cancer stages, and Gleason scores among prostate cancer patients. The mean survival time for patients aged \u226460 years was 60.0 months, while for those older than 60, it was 57.4 months, with no significant difference. Patients treated with both Zoladex and Casodex had a mean survival of 58.75 months, whereas those treated only with Casodex had a significantly lower mean survival of 23.50 months. Radiotherapy showed no significant impact on survival as shown in table 4. https://ejhm.journals.ekb.eg/ 2510 Table 4: Correlation between overall survival and age, treatment, stages and Gleason score among the studied prostate cancer patients Overall survival P value Mean survival (months) Estimate 95% CI Age Age \u226460 years 60.0 60.0 60.0 0.492 Age >60 years 57.4 53.9 60.9 Hormonal treatment Zoladex and Casodex 58.75 55.36 62.14 0.001 Casodex 23.50 0.00 49.14 Radical radiotherapy No 59.07 52.68 65.46 0.193 Yes 60.0 60.0 60.0 Stage T1 35.0 35.0 35.0 0.484 T2 60.0 60.0 60.0 T3 39.0 39.0 39.0 T4 59.91 49.695 59.124 Gleason score 7 56.7 47.96 65.4 0.426 8 60.0 60.0 60.0 9 49.0 43.49 54.6 10 60.0 60.0 60.0 Overall survival rates were 100% at 6 months and 1 year, 95.5% at 2 years, 88.9% at 3 years, and 66.7% at 5 years, with a mean survival of 57.7 months. Cancer stage significantly affected survival, with T2 and T4 stages showing higher mean survival times of 60.0 and 59.91 months, respectively, compared to T1 and T3 stages. Gleason scores did not significantly impact overall survival, though scores of 7, 8, and 10 showed higher mean survival times compared to score 9 as shown in table 5.

It is the most common cancer in men, with varying treatment outcomes depending on factors such as disease stage, patient characteristics, and treatment approach. Advances in medical knowledge and technology have led to improved diagnostic techniques and treatment options for prostate cancer. These include radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate gland), radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, and active surveillance. However, the relative effectiveness and long-term outcomes of these treatments remain areas of active research and clinical debate (8). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis and survival rates of prostate cancer patients treated at Sohag University Hospital. This retrospective study included 49 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and referred to the Oncology Department between January 2017 and January 2021. Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes, contextualized within the broader literature. The mean age at diagnosis in our cohort was 70.51 \u00b1 8.40 years, with a range from 49 to 88 years. The majority (89.8%) were over 60 years old, and 67.3% resided in rural areas. These demographics align closely with those reported by Wallis et al.(9) who found a median age of 64 years (IQR 59-69) in their study on treatment approaches and outcomes in localized prostate cancer. Similarly, Ozyigit et al.(10) reported a median age range of 68 years (41\u201388), and Amini et al.(11) noted that 49.3% of patients were over 70 years, with 45.8% between 56- 70 years. These findings underscore the generalizability of our age-related findings across different geographical and clinical settings. Our study revealed that 53.1% of patients were diagnosed with high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer, 42.9% had metastatic disease to bone, and 4.1% had intermediate-risk cancer. These results are consistent with those of Ozyigit et al.(10), who reported that 17.1% of patients had local, locoregional, or distant relapse and 12.0% had distant metastases. Yahaya et al.(12) observed that 40.5% of patients had lymph node involvement and metastasis to distant organs, with 22.3% involving distant organs other than lymph nodes, corroborating our findings on the spread of the disease at diagnosis. In terms of clinical staging, T2 was the most commonly observed stage (57.1%), followed by T4 (22.4%), T3 (16.3%), and T1 (4.1%). The mean Gleason score was 7.98 \u00b1 0.90, with a primary score of 4.23 \u00b1 0.63 and a secondary score of 3.77 \u00b1 0.63. These values are comparable to those reported by Ozyigit et al.(10) and diverge from Wallis et al.(9), who found that T1 was reported in 76% of their patients and T2 in 24%, with Gleason scores of \u22646 in 52%, 3+4 in 28%, and 8-10 in 10% of patients. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in patient selection and diagnostic criteria between studies. Our treatment data indicated that 75.9% of patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with a mean treatment duration of 23.65 \u00b1 11.7 months. This is in line with the findings of Wallis et al.(9), where 87% of patients received ADT, and Ozyigit et al.(10), who reported that 27.9% of patients received ADT for less than 2 years and 72.1% for more than or equal to 2 years, with a median duration of 24 months (range 2-72 months). The use of radiotherapy was less common, with only 38.8% receiving definitive radiotherapy, similar to patterns observed in the literature (10,11). Regarding outcomes, 28.6% of patients experienced a rise in PSA levels, and 6.1% died from cancer. The overall survival (OS) rate was 93.9% at the study's end, with a mean OS of 57.7 months. Our results are consistent with Ozyigit et al.(10), who reported that 82.4% of patients were alive at the end of their study, and Yahaya et al.(12), who found a 3-year OS rate of 67.6%. Notably, our study did not find significant differences in OS related to age or treatment modalities, aligning with Ozyigit et al.(10) but contrasting with Kim et al.(13) who reported age as a significant predictor of OS. CONCLUSION A significant number of patients were diagnosed with high-risk and metastatic prostate cancer, reflecting the severity of the cases. The treatments varied, with most patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy and a considerable number undergoing radiotherapy. The overall survival rate was relatively high, with no significant differences observed across various subgroups such as age, T stage, Gleason score, and receipt of radical radiotherapy.

Biopsy techniques varied, with ultrasound-guided biopsies being the most common (30 centres), followed by digital-guided (20 centres) and MRI-guided biopsies (5 centres). One centre lacked the expertise to perform biopsies. Radiological workup availability was high, with CT available in 56 centres, MRI in 54, PET scans in 14, and scintigraphy in 29. Treatment capabilities varied, with 53.4% of centres able to perform radical prostatectomies, 86.2% offering radiotherapy, and 94.8% providing medical castration. Among the centres, 56 performed fewer than 5 radical prostatectomies per month, while only 2 centres performed between 5 and 10 per month. Conclusion: It is important to standardise prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment protocols across Africa while improving access to advanced diagnostic technologies and treatment facilities. Implementing these changes could enhance early detection, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce the burden of prostate cancer in Africa. KEYWORDS prostate, prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen, urologist, prostate cancer, Africa 1 Introduction Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the \ufb01fth leading cause of cancer death in men in 2020, according to global cancer statistics. Its incidence varies from country to country (1). This variation can even exist within a single country. In the United States, it has been shown that the incidence of prostate cancer is higher in African-Americans than in Americans of other origins (2). Prostate cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death among men in 48 countries, including many in sub-Saharan Africa (1). In many countries or geographical areas, population-based epidemiological data are available (3\u20135). In Africa, only a few countries have population-based cancer registries, and these are not well equipped or regularly updated (6, 7). The diagnosis of prostate cancer is traditionally based on a combination of clinical, biological and histological data. Clinically, diagnosis is made by digital rectal examination, which assesses the shape, regularity and consistency of the prostate (8). Any abnormality of the prostate on digital rectal examination is an indication for prostate biopsy (9). Biologically, prostate cancer is suspected on the basis of elevated plasma levels of prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen. Prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen is a glycoprotein normally expressed by prostate tissue and can also be elevated in men even when there is no prostate cancer involvement (10). In the PSA- based screening program, most patients diagnosed with prostate cancer have a normal digital rectal examination (8). Thus, for diagnostic con\ufb01rmation of prostate cancer, a prostate biopsy is mandatory. The standard technique is ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate, taking 12 cores per extended sextant (8).In selected patients, magnetic resonance imaging may be required for targeted biopsy (11). MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy, especially in those patients with previous negative prostate biopsy but with persistent clinical signs and symptoms of prostate cancer. Biopsy protocols covering indications, preparation, procedure and management of complications are well de\ufb01ned by various national and international urology societies (12, 13). However, there are still wide differences in prostate biopsy practice patterns, according to a survey of 51 Nigerian urologists, which revealed variation in practice. The authors of this publication concluded that practice standardisation is required to increase consistency in patient treatment (14). On the basis of a range of clinical, biological and histological data, a classi\ufb01cation system has been proposed, stratifying patients into groups and guiding the performance of an extensive workup (thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT and bone scan) (15). Depending on D\u2019Amico\u2019s classi\ufb01cation and the presence or absence of metastases on imaging, several learned societies have de\ufb01ned recommendations for practice (12, 13). There has been a reported rise in the cancer burden in sub- Saharan Africa (16).

In addition to this huge burden, diagnosing and treating prostate cancer is challenging in sub-Saharan Africa. This is due to lack of access to diagnostic tools and limited healthcare resources. PSA testing, magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy are often limited. Treatment options are often limited by a lack of quali\ufb01ed human and material resources (18). Given the above, we have asked 3 questions within the context of sub-Saharan: 1. What is the current practice of urologists regarding prostate biopsy across Africa? 2. How do urologists classify patients to frame a therapeutic plan? 3. What therapeutic means are available, and what are the selection criteria? To answer these questions, we surveyed urologists practicing in hospitals in various African countries. The aim of this survey is to give a general overview of the current practice, to compare and contrast the various practice protocols and to propose strategies and recommendations for better screening, diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. 2 Methodology The Modern Urology for Africa (MUFA) association is a recently established continental initiative aimed at advancing urological care in Africa. MUFA conducted this qualitative multicentric survey as one of its diversi\ufb01ed scopes of research activities. A web-based, self-administered questionnaire targeting Africa\u2019s prostate biopsy and cancer management practices was designed and electronically disseminated to urologists in 45 African urology centres. These were mainly African public health care institutions with a functioning urology unit or a surgery unit with an attending urologist. The questionnaire contained the following questions speci\ufb01c to prostate cancer: \u2022 Prostate biopsy practice: patient consent, prostate biopsy preparation, monthly biopsies performed on average, biopsy technique and post-biopsy management. \u2022 Prostate cancer diagnosis, staging and imaging modalities. \u2022 Prostate cancer management: MDT meetings, management protocol, therapeutic modalities. \u2022 Prostate cancer treatment: androgen deprivation therapy (medical or surgical), chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. After pretesting and validation of the form by the authors, a Google Form was prepared and sent out through email and WhatsApp to African urologists for automatic data collection. The study was launched on February 12, 2024 and lasted for 6 consecutive weeks. Following data collection, a double check was carried out by authors to eliminate duplicates, and an arithmetical analysis was done. Results were expressed as absolute, mean or percentage values. No correlations were performed. 3 Results We received feedback from 58 centres spanning diverse African regions, such as Central Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa, East Africa, and Madagascar, like indicated in Figure 1. These institutions comprised general community hospitals, academic af\ufb01liated hospitals, and university hospitals. Table 1 displays the breakdown of participating hospitals categorised by their respective African regions. 3.1 Diagnosis In all subregions of Africa, i.e., Western, Eastern, Central, and Southern, prostate cancer ranks \ufb01rst in terms of prevalence among the studied urological cancers. Regarding the available screening and diagnostic modalities, the assay for prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) is available in almost all the mentioned hospital centres. The majority of centres (n=30, 50%) perform ultrasound-guided biopsies while 20 centres (35%) rely on \ufb01nger-guided prostate biopsies. Only a smaller number of centres perform MRI-guided biopsies (5 centres). Surprisingly, one centre reported an inability to perform prostate biopsies due to a lack of expertise (Figure 2). The cross-sectional diagnostic imaging modalities available in the various countries were CT scans (56 centres), followed by MRIs FIGURE 1 Regions and 28 countries represented in the survey (marked in blue).

For extensive workup, it was possible to do scintigraphy in 29 centres, while only 14 centres could do PET scans. The distribution of imaging modalities is in Figure 3. 3.2 Treatment In general, at least 1 therapeutic modality for prostate cancer could be proposed to patients in the centres involved in our survey. The distribution of these modalities varies from one centre to another. The distribution of those various modes of treatment being practiced in the surveyed urology centres is shown in Table 2. Radical prostatectomy was performed in 53.4% of the centres among the surveyed centres. Out of those 37 centres performing RP, 29 centres do <5 RP per month, while 2 centres do between 5 and 10 RP monthly. Concerning nonsurgical therapeutic modalities, they were distributed as shown in Table 3. In regards to radiotherapy, 50 responders (86.2%) reported it was available within their country. We could identify a radiotherapy unit/centre in 18 centres within 18 countries. Mainly, external beam therapy was possible; only 4 centres could offer brachytherapy. Either surgical or chemical hormonal suppression was possible in all centres, except 3 centres where medical castration was not available. So, only 94.8% of the centres could propose chemical androgen deprivation to patients. Immunotherapy was offered by 14 centres in 13 countries. Cryotherapy was only in 2 countries with 1 centre each. 4 Discussion The diagnosis and management of prostate cancer in Africa is of growing concern to the urology community. Although prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, diagnostic and therapeutic practices vary considerably across the continent, in\ufb02uenced by economic, cultural and infrastructural factors. This survey of urologists in various African hospitals provides an overview of current approaches to screening, diagnosis and treatment. By comparing these practices with international standards, this discussion aims to identify speci\ufb01c challenges encountered in Africa, regional variations in management approaches, and opportunities for improving patient outcomes. 4.1 Diagnosis of prostate cancer In western practice, digital rectal exam (DRE) is often performed during screening of prostate cancer and is used as a supporting but not de\ufb01nitive tool to detect prostate cancer. Its capabilities are limited due to its questionable reliability, reduced sensitivity, and inability to explore the entire surface of the prostate, especially when dealing with small tumours that have not yet developed to the point of reaching the prostatic capsule (19). The prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) blood test is also another clinical evidence that is used to assess suspicion of prostate cancer (20). In high-income countries, the use of technologies such as MRI is beginning to have a place in prostate cancer screening and surveillance (21). In Africa, DRE and PSA are almost always used for screening and diagnosing PCA. Determining PSA levels depends on the availability of a biomedical analysis laboratory. The results of this survey clearly demonstrated the unavailability of MRI in several centres that responded to the survey. In 2021, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) developed several harmonised consensus guidelines for sub- Saharan Africa in collaboration with the Africa Cancer Coalition (ACC). One of these guidelines is about early detection of prostate cancer. In this guideline, the NCCN acknowledges that the recommendations on prostate cancer screening methods and intervals are based on expert opinion, and a unanimous consensus has not been reached. Guidelines on when to start and stop screening, screening intervals and when to perform a biopsy are included in the guideline and should be used after the patient has been properly counselled (22). Just recently, the Lancet commission on prostate cancer published an article that draws attention to the increasing number of cases. Among the key points TABLE 2 Overview of the availability of Urological Services in Surveyed African Centres.

Biyouma et al. 10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951 Frontiers in Urology frontiersin.org 06 of this publication, it was made clear that late diagnosis of prostate cancer is widespread throughout the world, but particularly in low- income countries. Therefore, they recommended an urgent need to set up earlier diagnosis systems in low- and middle-income countries. For men of African descent, the case for prostate cancer screening lies between the ages of 45 and 70 (21). 4.2 Overview of the current guidelines for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer Screening for PCa is an area of frequent debate. Screening practices and guidelines aim to balance the early detection of clinically signi\ufb01cant cancers against the risk of potential overdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment of clinically insigni\ufb01cant PCa. The diagnosis of prostate cancer, like any other cancer type, is highly dependent on histopathological con\ufb01rmation. The decision to perform a prostate biopsy is made by a urologist based on abnormalities identi\ufb01ed during routine screening protocols or after clinical examination of a symptomatic patient (23, 24). Abnormal \ufb01ndings on DRE, elevation of PSA and a suspicious nodule on mp-MRI are the three most common scenarios that prompt a urologist to perform a prostate biopsy. There is no debate among urologists and oncologists on the need to analyse prostatic tissue samples before diagnosing prostate cancer and planning on the treatment options. However, the question is how these tissue samples are obtained (25). There is certain global variation in practice in this regard, and our study attempted to highlight the practice pattern in Africa. Until recently, a twelve-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)- guided core needle biopsy has been the standard according to the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines (26). Recently, a TRUS-guided transperineal biopsy has been recommended by these guidelines mainly to reduce the risk of infection, which is higher in a transrectal biopsy. Ef\ufb01cient diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer require exhaustive testing techniques speci\ufb01cally designed for the African environment. A prostate biopsy is a crucial diagnostic procedure that is frequently carried out blindly in many African nations. Our results illustrate that biopsy practices vary between regions. According to them, 20 centres were still practicing digital-guided biopsies, and 1 centre in particular could not perform biopsies. On the other hand, switching to image-guided biopsies\u2014ideally using fusion methods that combine MRI and ultrasound\u2014can greatly improve accuracy. We found out that only 5 centres could perform MRI-guided biopsies, but noted a shift toward ultrasound-guided biopsies, which were available in 30 centres. This makes single-use biopsy trocars, biopsy guidance devices, and endorectal ultrasonography probes necessary. Because image-guided prostate biopsy is a very simple operation to learn, urologists may \ufb01nd it easier to embrace if they participate in short-term training programs in these procedures. A study reported that twelve procedures are necessary to perform high-quality TRUS-guided prostate biopsies without compromising prostate cancer detection; therefore, they strongly recommended training under direct supervision for a minimum of 12 cases before allowing TRUS-guided biopsy without supervision (27). In the era of imaging-guided biopsy of the prostate, \ufb01nger- guided prostate biopsy still has a role in low- to middle-income countries. Concerning \ufb01nger-guided biopsy and TRUS-biopsy practices in Africa, even if the \ufb01rst one is far from gold-standard, it remains a suitable alternative in resource-limited settings, especially when the prostate is clinically abnormal (28). Perhaps in patients with palpable disease, the addition of \ufb01nger-guided prostate biopsy of these areas increased the positive predictive value over transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsies alone (29). Also, many countries are still practicing \u2018out-of-pocket\u2019 healthcare, and something as simple as a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy may be totally unaffordable. Therefore, in low- to middle- income countries, the cost of a prostate biopsy needs to be considered, as well as the cost to the patient, which may include time off work and travel costs. We did not distinguish between transrectal and transperineal ultrasound or MRI-guided biopsy technique in our survey; therefore, we could not discuss or compare the advantages of one over the other, including a reduction in infectious complications, improved quality of prostate sampling, and rebiopsy rates, which were reported in a systematic review on biopsy approaches as 15.4% in transrectal vs. 5.26% in transperineal (30).

They observed that prophylaxis based on the use of \ufb02uoroquinolones appears to be associated with a lower risk of infectious complications following transrectal prostate biopsy, compared to other prophylactic regimens, such as those involving cephalosporins or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (31). In addition, another study on the topic conducted in Nigeria comparing two groups of patients among whom Group 1 patients received a single dose of 1 g of amikacin intravenously 30 minutes prior to the procedure, followed by the immediate administration of 500 mg of oral cipro\ufb02oxacin after the transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB), while Group 2 patients were given the same antibiotics, but with a notable difference: cipro\ufb02oxacin was initiated one day before the procedure. Both patient groups were subsequently administered cipro\ufb02oxacin twice daily for a total duration of \ufb01ve days (32). They found a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the incidence and severity of sepsis in the second group. In this study, it was requested that antibiotics be used. We wanted to see clinical habits and compare them with the recommendations of learned societies. Recommendations on prostate cancer screening and early detection from main international urology societies, including AUA, EAU and NCCN guidelines, are highlighted and summarised in Table 4 (22, 33). The commonly used prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) screening is not widely accessible or affordable in this region. To address this, alternative screening methods like risk assessment approaches and cost-effective PSA tests are being explored to target high-risk individuals and improve screening access (18). 4.3 How these guidelines are implemented in practice in various regions of Africa Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) serve as frameworks to unify diagnostic criteria and guide clinical decision-making and to promote the highest standards of urological clinical care through education, research and the formation of health care policy. In Africa, the limited resources may preclude urologists from strictly adhering to international guidelines and recommendations. In addition, screening practices and guidelines for PCa and their availability vary across Africa (24). So, some countries have developed their own national guidelines. The American Urological Association (AUA), the European Urological Association (EAU), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) have standardised guidelines for the management of prostate cancer. From those guidelines, African management of prostate cancer is extrapolated. As an example in South Africa, local practitioners were commissioned to revise international CPGs with a view to applicability to South African clinical practice (34). Prostate cancer screening consists of systematic screening for the disease in an asymptomatic population. This early screening aims at early detection of these diseases and risk strati\ufb01cation; unfortunately, the major challenge experienced in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs) is the late presentation of PC patients in health facilities due partly to lack of screening, highlighting the need for accessible and affordable early detection programs (35). Despite the fact that mass screening is not recommended compared to individualised informed screening due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, many African countries, especially in SSA, still practice population-based screening, often initiated by local hospitals through public health campaigns. For example, in a TABLE 4 A summary of society's recommendations on prostate cancer early detection protocol.

The threshold is as low as 2.6 ng/ml for younger men. bThe EAU recommends to avoid/stop prostate cancer screening in men with < 15 yrs. Life expectancy. Biyouma et al. 10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951 Frontiers in Urology frontiersin.org 08 community-based screening program in Nigeria, 10% of men 50 years of age and over had a PSA over 4 mg/ml, and most had a PSA greater than 10 mg/ml. 8.5% were biopsied, and 1% had histologically con\ufb01rmed prostate cancer; no information was provided about treatments and outcomes (36). South African guidelines recommend that PCa screening (PSA and digital rectal examination [DRE]) should be performed in all men from 45 years onwards in the absence of identi\ufb01able risk factors and from 40 years in black men, where there is a family history of PCa and other identi\ufb01able risk factors (37). While international guidelines are shifting toward transperineal prostate biopsy and MRI-fusion biopsy, in our context, TRUS-guided biopsy as well as \ufb01nger-guided biopsy are still commonly done (14). Treatment with curative intent is not widely available and is often very costly in SSA. Currently, there is no consensus on the management of prostate cancer in Africa, as most of the treatment options are directly adopted from international guidelines. The availability of treatment modalities, namely, androgen-deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, varied widely among the countries. Notwithstanding, several authors have proposed prostate cancer updates depending on the stage and African subregion (18, 24, 38\u201340). 4.4 Challenges or barriers that exist in implementing these guidelines in different regions Diagnosis of prostate cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa is challenging due to limited access to diagnostic tools and healthcare resources, in addition to a low level of awareness by the community and the myths and misconceptions associated with it. The misconceptions include denial of conjugal rights if diagnosed with PCa, and one of the prevention methods is having multiple sexual partners, which predisposes for sexually transmitted disease and often judgement from the community (41). Clinical evaluation and digital rectal examination are commonly used, but PSA testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and biopsy are often restricted to a few locations. Consequently, many men in this region are diagnosed with advanced- stage cancer (39). The data from our study demonstrate an unequal and insuf\ufb01cient distribution of medical devices in healthcare facilities across Africa necessary for the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. For example, 22 countries have centres capable of performing a computerised tomography (CT) scan, 21 countries have centres with MRI facilities, 10 respondents\u2019 countries have centres equipped with scintigraphy, and only 5 countries have centres capable of performing a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This aligns with data obtained from the Global Health Observatory in 2014 (42), which showed the limited availability of cancer care equipment in Africa like mammography units, radiotherapy units, CT scanners, gamma camera units, MRI machines, and PET scanners. Radiotherapy centres are also scarce, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The availability of multimodal PCa treatment in various African countries is key to effectively managing this disease and adhering to standard recommendations. Countries such as Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and the Central African Republic, according to this study \ufb01nding, do not have radiotherapy centres, forcing eligible patients to seek treatment in neighbouring countries with associated economic costs. In Eswatini, the costs associated with prostate cancer (PCa) management are overwhelming. Due to the absence of radiation therapy in the country, the government must refer PCa patients to private hospitals in South Africa. While surgical procedures like transurethral resection can be performed locally, most patients also seek chemotherapy treatment in South Africa. The total annual cost of PCa to Eswatini is estimated at $6 million, including direct expenses for treatments and non-medical costs like transportation and lodging, which impose a signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nancial burden on patients (43). Urologists in Africa may encounter dif\ufb01culties adhering to international recommendations due to these resource and knowledge limitations. In our study, it was observed that not all urological centres perform radical prostatectomy due to a lack of technical expertise and adequate equipment. Furthermore, among those centres that do perform this procedure, the average monthly number of prostatectomies conducted by centres indicating af\ufb01rmative responses was approximately 5.33 cases per year. Our \ufb01ndings also highlight there are centres that do not offer radical prostatectomy services, which signi\ufb01cantly impacts both the quality of patient care and training of urologists. The dif\ufb01culty for African urological centres to accurately diagnose different stages of prostate cancer, due to limitations in existing diagnostic tests, can result in either underdiagnosis or overtreatment, posing a barrier to the implementation of the best international recommendations. Furthermore, the lack of attention given to the severity of prostate cancer in men compared to other types of cancer in women, such as breast and cervical cancer, can lead to a lack of attention and resources for the screening and early management of prostate cancer. The fact that many cases of prostate cancer in Africa remain undiagnosed and untreated re\ufb02ects systemic barriers to accessing healthcare and standard treatment. In particular, the centralisation of oncology facilities (including investigations, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) in urban areas and the shortage of specialised urologists and oncologists make access to care even more dif\ufb01cult for patients in rural areas. Public health expenditures are only $8 per capita, signi\ufb01cantly below the recommended $34. Most healthcare costs are paid out-of-pocket, comprising around 70% of total health spending (44). The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) mainly covers civil servants, leaving a large portion of the population uninsured. Endemic poverty exacerbates the situation, making healthcare unaffordable for many patients and leading to delays in seeking medical care (45). These systemic and organisational challenges can affect the quality of urological practices in Africa and explain why they may not always meet international standards. Aligning with international standards for prostate cancer management requires an upgrade of the technical infrastructure in African hospitals for prostate cancer diagnosis, improving the accessibility of these technical platforms to all patients, as well as strengthening training programs for healthcare professionals, including urologists, oncologists, and radiotherapists, to ensure they have the skills and expertise needed to provide quality care to prostate cancer patients. Biyouma et al. 10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951 Frontiers in Urology frontiersin.org 09 4.5 Limited access to diagnostic and treatment resources and up-to-date training for SSA Urologists With the recent advancement in the standardised reporting of prostatic MRI and the wide availability of it in higher-income countries, it has been used for the detection, localisation, and characterisation of clinically signi\ufb01cant prostate cancers (46). This recent development of using MRI as a screening tool in the detection of prostate cancer has aided urologists and oncologists in performing targeted biopsies and also avoiding unnecessary biopsies. The impact of these targeted biopsies is very high, especially in patients with prior negative biopsy results and still suspicious DRE and PSA results. In this survey, 46.7% (n=21) centres only have access to MRI, which will affect the quality of service provided, resulting in underdiagnosis by missing the cancer on biopsy or increased performance of biopsies. Radical prostatectomy has undergone a very rapid change from an open approach to a laparoscopic and robotic approach. From initial reports of both laparoscopic and robotic approaches in the beginning of 2000, it has gained wide popularity (47, 48). Now, minimally invasive radical prostatectomy, speci\ufb01cally robotic, is the standard. 91.5% of radical prostatectomies and more than 84% of prostatectomies in England and the USA, respectively, were done robotically (49). In Sub-Saharan Africa, few centres are able to perform radical prostatectomies, and usually it is an open approach. The eligibility of patients for this curative approach is also dependent on early presentation, proper staging, and the availability of skilled urologists who can offer the surgery. South Africa is the \ufb01rst African country to perform robotic radical prostatectomy and also has many robotic surgery centres (50). The price of acquiring robots and the running cost per procedure have made it unthinkable for most African centres. In addition to its expensiveness, the unavailability of training centres in Africa and the dif\ufb01culty of securing on-hand training in high-income countries make even the disparity in radical prostatectomy an ongoing challenge. The Vattikuti Foundation has played a signi\ufb01cant role in training more than 50 fellows in robotic surgery in India (51). Africa also needs collaboration from this type of foundation and international stakeholders to train and equip the urologists with the necessary skills. 4.6 The need for strengthening the technical skills It is important for urologists to remain up-to-date regarding research and clinical guidelines within their specialty. Prostate cancer rarely involves a single treatment; patient care can be as diverse as the disease itself. Its management often requires a multispecialty team dedicated to managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment. This approach has been reported to improve quality-of-life issues for these patients. The availability of primary treatment modalities, namely, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, varied widely among the countries in which the urologists practiced based on their referral patterns. Uro-oncology has emerged as a subspecialty that plays an important role in the daily practice and care of urologic malignancies. Its role is so important in standardising the care and in a continuation of urologic oncology training, especially with updated guidelines, changing treatment modalities, new oncological drugs, developments in advanced technology, and the increasing use of laparoscopic, robotic, and endoscopic techniques. A study showed that 40.54% of the urologists did not \ufb01nd the uro-oncology training in their own country to be suf\ufb01cient, so there is a need for training after residency to be supported by not only the authorities but also the urologists in the \ufb01eld to strengthen their skills (52). Also, surgery training is essential; this is illustrated by the results of multi- institutional analysis, which showed that only 11% of patients treated by high-volume surgeons experienced a biochemical recurrence at \ufb01ve years, compared to 18% of patients treated by low-volume surgeons (53). Performing radical prostatectomy is a key tool for urologists dealing with prostate cancer, especially for eligible patients. Mastering this technique comes with training and practice. Postoperative morbidity in high-volume centres has a 6% absolute reduction in postoperative complication rates (26% vs. 32%), an 8% absolute reduction in late urinary complications (20% vs. 28%), and a 4% absolute reduction in long-term incontinence (16% vs. 20%), compared to those treated by low-volume surgeons (54). Apart from fellowship, urologists indicated an interest in taking courses designed to educate them on prostate cancer care even after residency. Consequently, they should be encouraged to participate in continuous medical education and workshops, to be members of different societies and groups, to subscribe to journals or newsletters, to attend scienti\ufb01c meetings and programs, and to collaborate with other \ufb01elds. Guidelines are developed to improve the quality of patient care. 4.7 Implications for clinical practice This study has shown a signi\ufb01cant disparity in diagnostic and treatment resources between different centres, not only based on the country but also within the same country. This situation has a considerable practical impact, particularly on the reliability of diagnosis, the quality of disease staging, and especially patient management. Even though many efforts have been made to improve diagnostic means, as highlighted by our study (all centres perform prostate biopsies except one), many patients are diagnosed at a late metastatic stage, mainly due to the absence of early screening or the unavailability of tests. Digital rectal examination and PSA testing are available in almost all centres. In a review, Jalloh et al. reported that the unavailability of certain equipment, the lack of expertise among human resources, and the high cost of exams and treatments result in each centre operating according to the available means (18). Similarly, it was reported by Tanzanian authors that there is a signi\ufb01cant disparity in the prices of diagnostics and treatments between different centres in the country, and these prices remain relatively high compared to the patients\u2019 means (55). It would be bene\ufb01cial to establish or encourage collaboration between different centres within the same country and the sub-region, which would increase the level of detection and patient management. Biyouma et al. 10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951 Frontiers in Urology frontiersin.org 10 4.8 Study limitation There was no systematic sampling for selecting the hospitals involved in this study, and therefore the possibility of sampling errors exists, and the results may not re\ufb02ect the overall picture of prostate cancer diagnostic and treatment modalities in Africa. Our sample size and unknown response rate may not represent the population for which the survey was intended. These may mean our results may be subject to the in\ufb02uence of chance factors. Although there was a mixture of different African country representatives, information about the unrepresented countries may have changed our result signi\ufb01cantly. It is also important to recognise that the responding urologist may have limited knowledge about the countries he is practicing in. The questions were not competency-based and did not assess de\ufb01ciencies of skills or knowledge in PCa. Therefore, it was not possible to determine whether any de\ufb01ciencies in skills or knowledge were signi\ufb01cant enough to affect their response. Furthermore, the possibility of response bias cannot be completely eliminated in this study. 5 Conclusion The diagnosis and management of prostate cancer in Africa face signi\ufb01cant challenges due to late diagnosis, inadequate manpower, poor health facilities, and limited treatment options. Our survey highlights disparities in diagnostic capabilities, with some centres lacking essential imaging modalities and biopsy techniques. Treatment options also vary widely, with only a few centres offering comprehensive care, including surgery and advanced therapies. There\u2019s a need to improve early detection and patient outcomes by increasing public awareness, developing screening programs, and investing in novel diagnostic and treatment options. Strengthening technical skills through continuous education and training, enhancing infrastructure, and fostering collaboration among healthcare centres are essential steps toward reducing the burden of prostate cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.
