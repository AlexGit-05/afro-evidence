Box 7845 Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. \nE-mail: syongolo@muchs.ac.tz \n \nObjective: To determine the proportion of patients with Carcinoma of the Prostate in patients presenting \nwith Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms. \nMethods: This was a four years prospective case finding study of patients aged 50 years and above with \nLower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) in a private hospital in Dar-Es Salaam. Investigations included \nrenal function tests, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and prostatic biopsy.  \nResults: Of the 201 consecutive patients with LUTS, 86.1% had BPH while 13.9% had Prostate Carcinoma \n(CP) with an average PSA of 51.99 ng/ ml. Digital rectal examination (DRE) was abnormal in 23 cancer \npatients. In 2 patients diagnosis followed finding a raised PSA. In 3 patients carcinoma was an incidental \nfinding following TURP. Treatment consisted of orchidectomy in 24 patients, Lutenizing Hormone Releasing \nHormone (LHRH) agonist (Zoladex) in two while one patient received radiotherapy.  Two of the patients \nwho had incidental CP finding with low Gleason score were on watchful waiting. \nConclusion: Case finding rather than community screening for prostate cancer is preferred due to economic \nreasons. PSA when available is a useful additional investigation. Efforts should be made to detect the disease \nearly as the urologists in the region arm themselves ready for the challenge of radical prostatectomy. \n \nIntroduction \n \nPatients with prostate cancer may present with \nvoiding symptoms suggestive of bladder outlet \nobstruction or those related to metastatic disease. The \nprevalence of prostate cancer continues to increase \nwith age, and after age 50, both incidence and \nmortality rate from prostate cancer increase at a near \nexponential rate1.  \n \nAt present, prostate cancer is the most common \ncancer diagnosed in men in the United States and the \nsecond most common cause of cancer death. Blacks \nliving in the USA have a higher incidence rate of \nclinical prostate cancer than white men of similar \neducation and socio-economic classes at all ages2. \nFurthermore, black men are routinely diagnosed with \nlate stage disease, and survival rates, even when \ncorrelated for stage, are uniformly lower for black \nmen. The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is \nmade, in the majority of cases, by prostatic needle \nbiopsy.  Thus, suspicion of prostate cancer is most \noften raised by abnormalities found on digital rectal \nexamination (DRE), or serum prostate-specific \nantigen (PSA) elevations. \n \nRoutine use of PSA increases the detection of \nprostate cancer over that of DRE, improves the \npredictive value of the DRE for cancer, and increases \nthe detection of prostate cancers that are organ \nconfined yet significant in terms of size and grade.   \n \n \nPSA is the single test with the highest positive \npredictive value for cancer of the prostate 3.   \n \nIt has been reported in different studies in screened \npopulations that the approximate chance of cancer on \nbiopsy is 1 in 50 for men with PSA levels below 4.0 \nng/ml3, 1 in 4 for PSA levels of 4.0 to 10 ng/ml, and \n1 in 2 to 3 for PSA levels greater than 10 ng/ml4,5.  \nPSA increases the predictive value of the DRE for \ncancer of the prostate6,7.  A decrease in the mortality \nrate of prostate cancer following introduction of \nscreening has been reported8,9.    \n \nIn developing countries however, health provision is \nsub-optimal due to poor economy, and screening \nprocedures cannot be done due to cost constraints. It \nfollows therefore that the use of PSA as a screening \ntool for CP in the community is not feasible10,11. \nIntroduction of new diagnostic tests in developing \ncountries are delayed and when available are \nexpensive and inaccessible to the general public. \nWhen introduced few private laboratories own them. \nThis prohibits the tests to be used for screening \npurposes.  PSA was introduced in Tanzania five years \nago. This paper presents the experience on case \nfinding of prostate cancer in patients presenting with \nlower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in a private \nclinic in Dar- Es Salaam.   \n \n \n \n \nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery Volume 9 Number 2 - December2004 \n18\n \nPatients and Methods \n \nThis was a prospective case finding study of four \nyears in a private hospital in the centre of Dar-Es \nSalaam during the period of January 2000 to \nDecember 2003. Patients eligible for this study were \nall those who were 50 years or more who presented \nwith lower urinary tract symptoms requiring \ninvestigations and treatment. The hospital had one \nworking urologist who saw all patients presenting \nwith urology problems. Those patients had a history \nand physical examination done except digital rectal \nexamination (DRE), which was carried out after \nblood for PSA had been drawn.  \n \nOther investigations done included serum creatinine, \nabdominal ultrasound of the kidney, ureter, bladder \nand prostate. The hospital has no rectal probe for \nTrans-rectal \nultrasound \n(TRUS). \nThe \nother \ninvestigations were tailored to the other presenting \nsymptoms and signs of the patient. Those who had \nurethral stricture with a normal PSA and DRE were \nhowever excluded, as the tissue biopsy was not \nobtained. The age of the patient and the presenting \nsymptoms were recorded. The urologist documented \nall the findings of the DRE. Those patients who had \nabnormal DRE findings in the prostate had a tru-cut \nbiopsy taken from the prostate by finger guidance.  \n \n \n \nPatients who had an elevated PSA without suspicious \nnodule had sextant core biopsies done. Cut off point \nfor PSA in the lab was 4ng/ml.  \n \nPatients who had significant urinary symptoms were \ntreated by TURP or open prostatectomy. Tissues \nfrom prostatectomy were examined to determine \nwhether prostate cancer was evident. The Gleason \nscore was also done and recorded at histology.  \n \nPatients with prostate cancer were treated by \nOrchidectomy, \nLutenizing \nHormone \nReleasing \nHormone (LHRH) agonist (Zoladex), Radiotherapy \nor watchful waiting according to the stage and grade \nof the disease. \n \nResults \n \nA total of 219 consecutive patients with lower \nurinary tract symptoms were seen at the hospital. \nHowever 201 are presented in this study. Eighteen \npatients who had LUTS secondary to urethral \nstricture were excluded as none of them had prostate \nbiopsy done. The age range of the patients was from \n50 to 98 with a mean of 68.4 years. The majority \n(72.1%) of the patients belonged to the age groups \n60\u201369 and 70\u201379 (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1.

Detection of Carcinoma of the prostate. \n \nMethod Of Detection \nNumber Of Patient \nAbnormal DRE \n23 \nRaised PSA \n2 \nIncidental Carcinoma \n3 \n \n \nThe \nreason \nfor \nconsultation \nwas \nsignificant \nbothersome symptoms of lower urinary tract in 101 \n(50.2%) of the patients and retention of urine in 86 \n(42.8%). The other presenting features were stones, \nhernia and UTI.         Two patients had paraplegia \ndue to metastasis of CP to the spine (Table 2). Taking \nall patients together the average PSA measured by \nMin-Vadas France BioMurex Lab reagents was \n13.12ng/ml. However the average PSA in the 173 \npatients with BPH was 6.71ng/ml. Patients with \nprostatic cancer had an average PSA of 51.99ng ml.\n \nThe range of PSA was 0.68 to >100 ng/ml. The upper \nrange in this laboratory was indicated as more than \n100 a draw back to the average results of PSA to \ncancer group of patients. \n \nTwenty-eight (13.9%) of all patients had prostate \ncancer and had an average age of 68.7 years. Apart \nfrom lower urinary tract symptoms some patients \npresented with metastatic symptoms of paraplegia, \nlow back pain, anaemia, oedema of the legs, weight \nloss and general weakness. The DRE was abnormal \nin 23 patients together with raised PSA. Two patients \nwithout abnormality of DRE were diagnosed CP on \nfinding a raised PSA. The other three patients were \ndiagnosed as incidental findings from TURP with a \nnormal PSA (Table 3). Twenty-four patients had  \n \nOrchidectomy as the treatment (one patient started \nwith Zoladex and had to have Orchidectomy done \ndue to cost constraint); one patient was treated with \nLHRH agonist Zoladex while one patient received \nradiotherapy outside the country. Two of the three \npatients who had incidental carcinoma with a \nfavourable Gleason score were managed on watchful \nwaiting with regular PSA checks.  \nDiscussion \n \nThe advantage of early diagnosis of prostate cancer \nand its treatment by radical surgery and its influence \nto \nsurvival \nis \nwell \ndocumented12. \nBeing \nasymptomatic in the early stage, prostate cancer \ndiscovery is facilitated by the use of screening and \nPSA, which has increased the detection and lead to \nthe recommendation of mass screening for it13,14. \nHowever the debate on the logic of treatment of \nlocalized disease, which is usually found during \nscreening with the slow growth of the tumour has \nalso been posed15.  Moreover community screening \nof prostate cancer by use of PSA is expensive and \nthough desirable is prohibitive in poor countries \nwhere case finding studies will remain the main \nsource of data. \n \nThe mean age in this series of patients was slightly \nhigher than those reported in one publication in this \ncontinent10. All of the patients had significant lower \nurinary tract symptoms. The majority of the patients \n(86.1%) were found to have BPH while 13.9% had \nprostate cancer. This ratio is slightly higher than that \nreported in Egypt10 but is comparable with findings in \nanother study which on top of DRE and PSA used \nTransrectal \nUltrasound \n(TRUS) \nwhich \ncould \nprobably explain the higher pick up ratio16. The high \nratio in our series of patients, may be an indication of \na possibly high incidence of Carcinoma of the \nProstate in our population in black Africa.  \n     \nIndeed prostate cancer rarely causes symptoms early \nin the course of disease because the majority (70-\n85%) of adenocarcinoma arises in the periphery of \nthe gland (peripheral zone), distant from the urethra.  \nIn the other group of patients (15-30%), the cancer \ndevelops from the other zones.  The presence of \nsymptoms as a result of prostate cancer suggests \ncoexistence with BPH, a locally advanced or \nmetastatic disease, as was the case in the majority of \nour patients who had advanced disease at diagnosis. \nOnly five patients out of the twenty-eight patients \nwere diagnosed with early malignancy and would \nqualify for Radical Prostatectomy. \n \nAll suspicious lesions at DRE underwent a biopsy \nand confirmed the disease a high pick up rate.  In one \nseries it was reported that approximately 50% of \nsuspicious lesions represented cancer on prostate \nbiopsy 17.  Because of the significant risk of prostate \ncancer, prostate biopsy is recommended for all men \n \n \n \nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery Volume 9 Number 2 - December2004 \n20\n \nwho have DRE abnormalities, regardless of the PSA \nlevel, since there is still a chance, however small of \nCP even when PSA level is less than 4 ng/ml 3.  It is \nof paramount important to note here that till now \nclinical presentation and   abnormal DRE remains the \nmain way of diagnosis of CP in most of the hospitals \nin this country. However, we also emphasize that \nDRE misses from 23% to 45% of the cancers that are \nsubsequently found with prostatic biopsies done for \nserum PSA elevation or Trans-rectal ultrasound \nabnormalities18,19. In our series five patients would \nhave been missed since their DRE was normal. \n \nThe studied population here is not a representative \nsample as this was a selected group who can afford \ntreatment in a private hospital. Secondly the number \nof patients is small to draw a conclusion but the \nproportion of CP is high. Also the stage at which the \ndisease at diagnosis was advanced similar to What \nothers report that prostate cancer detected by DRE in \nscreened and unscreened populations of men are \npathologically advanced in more than 50% of men15. \nWhere \npossible \nin \ndeveloping \ncountries \na \ncombination of DRE and PSA in patients with LUTS \nshould be used to pick up more cases with CP. There \nis however a need to establish the true prevalence of \nCP in a black African country by a well planned \nrandomized study using PSA, DRE and TRUS. \nReferences \n \n1. \nWingo P A, Tong T, Boldern S: Cancer \nstatistics.

In Kenya, PC is ranked as the most \nprevalent cancer in males with 2864 new cases  \n \n(14.9%) in 2018 (3). Generally, low rates of PC \nscreening have been reported among Black men (4, \n5). \nGlobally, prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening \nremains a much debated issue with varying \nrecommendations across countries. Nevertheless, \nthere is a general agreement on utilization of shared \ndecision-making in-line with the US Preventive \nMBUGUA ET AL.\n \n \nJuly 2021 | Volume 18 | Issue 3                       131               The ANNALS of AFRICAN SURGERY| www.annalsofafricansurgery.com \nServices Task Force recommendations (6). The \nscreening \nguidelines \nin \nKenya \nrecommend \nindividualized risk-based screening through shared \ndecision-making between the client and clinician \namong men aged 40\u201369 years (3). The screening \nrates, however, remain abysmally low despite high \nintention to screen (7\u201310). Unfortunately, the number \nof men diagnosed with advanced aggressive PC is on \nthe rise with an alarming increase in mortality \nattributed to low uptake of screening (3, 11). Despite \nequivocal evidence given on the effects of PC \nscreening on mortality, risk-based screening aimed at \nearly treatment initiation is vital (7). \nThe low uptake of PC screening among Kenyan men \ndespite a considerably high level of awareness \nremains a great puzzle in public health that requires \nfurther investigation. There is a paucity of studies on \nbarriers to PC screening in developing countries. The \nfew studies carried out in Kenya are quantitative, \nhence they lack a deeper exploration of the factors \ninfluencing screening. The success of PC prevention \nand \ncontrol \nprograms \nrequires \nan \nin-depth \nunderstanding of contextual factors influencing \nuptake of screening. The study therefore applied a \nqualitative approach to explore context-specific \nbarriers and facilitators to PC screening among \nKenyan men in a rural community. \n \nMethods \nDesign \nWe used a descriptive exploratory qualitative study \ndesign. \n \nStudy site \nThe study was conducted in Gatundu-North and \nKiambu Sub-counties in Kiambu County, which are \nlocated in the central region of Kenya. The sub-\ncounties were selected as they have linked health \nfacilities which offer PC screening services. The \npopulation in the study area is demarcated into \nCommunity Units (CUs) for the purpose of \nimplementation of community health strategy. All the \n17 CUs were included in the study. \n \nStudy population \nThe study participants included 59 men aged 40\u201369 \nyears, the eligible age for screening in Kenya (3). The \nkey informants (KIs) included members of the \nCounty \nand \nSub-county \nHealth \nManagement \nCommittee including public health nurses and \nofficers and community health strategy coordinators. \n \nSampling technique \nThe focus group discussion (FGD) participants were \npurposively selected which aimed at ensuring \nheterogeneity and representation of various socio-\neconomic and demographics characteristics. The \nselection of the KIs was facility-based and included \nthe key people involved in the implementation of the \nCommunity Health Strategy in the sub-counties. \n \nData collection tools \nA semi-structured guide based on the key themes of \nthe study was used to conduct the interviews in the \nmonths of March\u2013April 2019. The key themes of the \nstudy which included the barriers and facilitators of \nthe uptake of screening were included in the guide. \n \nInternal validity and reliability \nLincoln and Guba criteria were used for enhancing \ntrustworthiness. Several debriefing sessions were \nheld by the research team members, who used \nmultiple coders ensuring consensus from the team \nmembers before the generation of themes. Referential \nadequacy was ensured by a review of the original data \nand findings by two members of the research team \nwho had vast experience in qualitative data analysis \nand multiple reviews of the data by other research \nteam members before generation of codes to ensure \nthe credibility of the data. Operationalization was also \ndone through member checking at the end of \ninterviews and keeping an audit trail of all the steps \nundertaken \nduring \nanalysis \nto \nensure \nrigor. \nResearcher and methodological triangulation was \nalso done (12). \n \n \n                                               BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO UPTAKE OF PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING \n \nThe ANNALS of AFRICAN SURGERY| www.annalsofafricansurgery.com             132                July 2021 | Volume 18 | Issue 3               \nData collection procedure \n \n               \nWe conducted six FGDs which consisted of 59 \ncommunity members and seven individual in-depth \ninterviews with KIs and achieved saturation with a \ntotal of 66 participants. Each FGD was made up of \nthe principal investigator and two research assistants. \nThe FGD was conducted in a private set-up within the \nlinked health facilities at the study site. The FGD was \nmade up of nine to eleven participants. The average \nduration was 82 minutes. The KI interviews lasted \nbetween 30 and 45 minutes. All the interviews were \naudio recorded and transcribed verbatim. \n \nEthical approval \nThe study was approved by the Jomo Kenyatta \nUniversity \nof \nAgriculture \nand \nTechnology \nInstitutional \nEthics \nReview \nCommittee \n(JKU/2/4/896B), the National Council of Science and \nTechnology (NACOSTI P/19/71673/28322) and the \nMinistry of Health. Participant\u2019s autonomy and \nprivacy were maintained throughout the study and \nwritten consent was sought following the explanation \nof the purposes, benefits, risks, and ground rules of \nthe session by the moderator. \n \nData analysis \nThe study applied inductive thematic analysis. The \ntranscripts underwent de-identification of participants \nwith codes. The research team immersed themselves \nin the data to enhance familiarization and \ntriangulation of the data. The data was then coded \nindependently by two researchers using the grounded \ntheory (12). The final codes were generated based on \nconsensus from the research team which included \nexperienced researchers. The coding entailed the \nanalysis \nof \nspecific \nstatements \nand \ntheir \ncategorization into themes. This was followed by \nsearching for the themes and researcher triangulation \ncoupled with the diagrammatic representation of the \nconnection of themes for further interrogation. Then \na review of the themes and sub-themes was done and \ncomparison with the raw data and the transcripts was \ndone multiple times before the generation of codes. \nThe main themes were then named and defined \nthrough consensus of the research team members and \nconsultation of two experts in the subject.

A participant \nstated: \u201cWho really wants to go for screening? It will be \nlike you are informing other people of your inability to \nperform sexually, it\u2019s too shameful for any man.\u201d \n \nDiscussion \nOur study identified several barriers and facilitators to \nthe uptake of PC screening in a rural community in \nKenya. Experience of symptoms, proximity and \nprominence of cancer, accessibility of screening \nservices, and advocacy were reported as facilitators of \nscreening similar to those reported in other studies (13, \n14). Clinicians should engage at-risk men presenting \nwith urinary symptoms in shared decision-making in \nline with the screening guidelines (3). The provision of \naffordable screening services and the inclusion of \nperipheral facilities can be explored to circumvent the \nbarriers to accessibility of the services. Public health \nawareness on PC should be incorporated in routine care \nand reinforced in the community through a collaboration \nof clinicians and community-based health workers. \nIn the study, lack of knowledge on PC was reported as a \nmajor barrier to uptake of screening. This finding is \ncorroborated with studies conducted among men in the \nSub-Saharan African region and Kenya (8, 9, 15). \nParticipation of men in screening is highly dependent on \ntheir knowledge about PC and the benefits of early \ndetection. Low perception of self-vulnerability to PC \nreported among this at-risk population has been reported \nin previous studies (16\u201318). Perception of self-\nMBUGUA ET AL.\n \n \nJuly 2021 | Volume 18 | Issue 3                     135                   The ANNALS of AFRICAN SURGERY| www.annalsofafricansurgery.com \nvulnerability is critical in enhancing the uptake of \nscreening (19). Targeted programs involving clinicians \nto reach at-risk men to enhance PC awareness and risk \nperception in the health care facilities and communities \nare urgently required. \n \nFatalistic beliefs reported as barriers to screening in our \nstudy have been reported previously (9, 20). Fatalism is \nmainly attributed to a lack of knowledge and negative \noutcomes of PC (21). Clinicians can overcome these \nfatalistic beliefs through education of at-risk men, timely \ndiagnosis and navigation of patients which will \ncontribute towards improvement in PC treatment \noutcomes (20, 22). The male dominance factors reported \nin the study have been documented in previous studies \n(14, 23, 24). The preference of provision of screening \nservices by older men was reported in the study. This \ncan be explored by capacity building of male clinicians \nand inclusion of lower cadres like male nurses for \nprovision of culturally acceptable screening services. \nClinician recommendation is fundamental in PC \ndecision-making processes. Evidence shows that low PC \nscreening \nis \nassociated \nwith \nweak \nphysician \nrecommendation (25). An important question given our \nresults is the involvement of clinicians in awareness \ncreation and recommendation of screening to at-risk \nmen. A study conducted in Kenya reported that only \n10% of the screened men had a recommendation from a \nhealth care provider while a majority were not involved \nin decision-making (7). The need for sensitization of all \nclinicians on the current screening guidelines cannot be \nover \nemphasized. \nThe \nstudy \nrecommends \nthe \ndevelopment of decision aids to enhance informed \ndecision-making among men and to facilitate the \nimplementation of shared decision-making process \namong clinicians. \n \nConclusion \nThe study identified several barriers and facilitators to \nPC screening. Lack of knowledge remains a major \nbarrier to screening as it contributes to myths and \nmisconceptions, low perception of self-vulnerability, \nand negative beliefs. There is a need for targeted \nprograms involving clinicians to reach at-risk men to \nenhance public awareness on PC. Integration of \nculturally sensitive education to regular care should be \nadopted. Capacity building of clinicians, task shifting, \nand provision of well-coordinated affordable screening \nservices in peripheral facilities should be explored. The \nconcerted effort among policy makers and all health care \nworkers to overcome the stated barriers to screening is \nhighly recommended. \n \nStrengths and limitations \nThe strength of the study includes the use of multiple \nmethods of data collection that enhanced the validity of \nthe study. However, the selection of participants was \npurposive sampling. Nevertheless, the researchers \nensured heterogeneity in regard to socio-economic and \ndemographic characteristics and stratification using the \nCUs while the KIs were multi-disciplinary. The \nparticipants were from a rural community, and hence the \nresults may not be entirely generalized to urban \ncommunities. \n \nReferences \n1. \nWorld Health Organization.

This retrospective report details the cases of \n12 patients with earlobe clefts, only 1 of which was a congenital cleft, managed at a teaching hospital in Abuja, Nigeria, over 18 \nmonths. Nine patients in this series were children \u22642 years of age, and 3 were adults in their 20s or 30s. Eight patients presented \nwith pressure necrosis from gold-plated stud earrings, and 3 patients had traction injuries from hoop earrings. According to the \nBlanco-D\u00e1vila and V\u00e1sconez classification system, 1 patient had a type I cleft, 6 patients had type II clefts, and 5 patients had type III \nclefts. The corrective techniques employed were the Pardue method (n=2), Z-plasty (n=5), and a combination (n=5) of the Pardue \nand Z-plasty methods. Immediate surgical outcomes were favourable; however, all patients were lost to follow-up.\nKeywords: cleft earlobe, pressure necrosis, earlobe repair, Nigeria\nIntroduction\nB\nody piercing, a method of body adornment well rec\u00ad\nognized since antiquity,[1],[2] is most commonly seen \nin the form of earlobe piercing. This procedure, although \nwidespread, is not without potential complications, includ\u00ad\ning some that are life-threatening.[3] Acquired cleft earlobe \nis an uncommon complication of ear piercing,[4],[5] but its \nincidence has increased as the practice of ear piercing has \ncontinued to be fashionable.[6],[7] Acquired cleft of the ear\u00ad\nlobe is commonly caused by sudden traction on the earlobe \nor the wearing of heavy earrings.[6] Pressure necrosis has \nrarely been reported as a cause of cleft earlobe.[8]-[10] Nna\u00ad\ndozie et al.[8] alluded to aseptic ear-piercing practices being \nthe primary cause of cleft earlobe secondary to necrotizing \nsoft tissue infection. A cross-sectional survey conducted \nby Gabriel et al.[5] determined a low incidence of infection \n(13.4%) and cleft earlobes (8.5%) as complications of earlobe \npiercing, though the majority of their respondents had their \nears pierced at home with no specific attention to asepsis. \nMost patients present as chronic cases,[6] though some may \npresent as acute cases.[5]\nAcquired cleft of the earlobe is classified as complete \nor incomplete, each of which could be unilateral or bilat\u00ad\neral, as per the classification outlined by Blanco-D\u00e1vila and\nV\u00e1sconez.[7] Complete tears usually result from sud\u00ad\nden traction on the earlobe, while partial tears are more \ncommon in older women due to the chronic use of heavy\nearrings.[11],[12] Clefts of the earlobe are further subclassi\u00ad\nfied into 3 types: type I (boundaries of the cleft hole extend\u00ad\ning less than half the distance between the original piercing \nand the inferior margin of the earlobe), type II (boundaries \nof the cleft hole extending more than half the distance), and \ntype III (also known as complete cleft of the earlobe) where \nthe cleft hole completely splits the earlobe.[11],[13]\nVarious methods of repair have been described for the \nvarious grades from ancient times[1],[11] to many other \nmethods by recent authors.[3],[6]-[11] The repair methods \nare classified into straight-line or broken-line repair.[14] \nMost of these are fraught with recurrence or cosmetic dis\u00ad\nsatisfaction.[6],[15]\nWe report 12 patients with acquired cleft earlobe who \nwere operated on in our plastic surgery unit.\nAmina I.

The first, known as Pardue repair, is a straight-\nline method involving the excision of the cleft margins \nwhile preserving a small transpositional flap to facilitate \nthe recreation of an earring hole at the time of the repair\n(Figure\u00a01).[16] The second technique, a broken-line repair, is \nsimilar to the first but incorporates a Z-plasty, as described \nby Hamilton and LaRossa (Figure 2).[17] The final technique \nconsists of Z-plasties alone, with ear piercing performed \nat a subsequent appointment, a method introduced by\nHarahap (Figure 3).[18]\nResults\nDuring the 18-month period, 12 ear clefts were repaired. The \npatients\u2019 ages ranged from 9 months to 37 years, with 9 of the \nrepairs performed on children \u22642 years of age (Table).\nThe incidence of cleft earlobes was evenly distributed be\u00ad\ntween the left and right ears.\nAll cases were acquired, with the exception of 1 con\u00ad\ngenital cleft. The most prevalent cause was pressure necrosis \nfrom stud earrings (n=8), followed by traction injury from \nhoop earrings (n=3). Notably, all instances of pressure ne\u00ad\ncrosis occurred in children.\nAccording to the Blanco-D\u00e1vila and V\u00e1sconez classifica\u00ad\ntion, type II clefts (n=6) were the most common, followed by \ntype III (n=5), then 1 type I (n=1).\nAll patients with pressure necrosis had experienced 72 \nhours of oedema, and dark patches were observed by the car\u00ad\negivers before the cleft earlobes were noticed.\nPardue repair alone was performed on 2 of the patients, \nwhile Z-plasty was used for 5 of the repairs, and a combi\u00ad\nnation of Pardue repair and Z-plasty was applied to the\nother 5 cases.\nTable 1.

Earlobe piercing \nis commonly performed in infancy in our context. Gabriel et \nal.[5] found that 66% of respondents pierced their children\u2019s \nearlobes within the first 4 weeks of life. This was similarly \nreported by Haboor and El Mustafa.[3] Although the usual \ncauses of cleft ear lobe are traction and gravity,[6],[7] our se\u00ad\nries identified a rarer cause: pressure necrosis from stud ear\u00ad\nrings. Pressure necrosis as a cause of acquired cleft earlobe \nwas initially reported by McLaren[9], as well as Wallace and \nGarretts,[10] as a complication of earrings with spring clips, \nwhich, like stud earrings, can exert excessive pressure on the \nearlobes.[20] More recently, Nnadozie et al.[8] described ne\u00ad\ncrotizing fasciitis secondary to non-aseptic ear piercing as \na probable pathophysiological mechanism. Gabriel et al.[5] \nfound that only 6% of their participants used a piercing gun, \nwhile 71% used stud earrings, and 23% used a needle and \nthread for piercing.[5] The earlobe\u2019s anatomy, comprising \nskin, fibrofatty tissue, end arteries, and nerve endings,[21] \nmay elucidate why excessive pressure from stud earrings \ncan result in pressure necrosis. The fact that all the affected \nchildren were \u22642 years old might explain why the parents \ndid not notice the pain. As Gabriel et al.[5] found, many \nparents believe that children of this age group are not aware \nof pain in their earlobes. Nnadozie et al.[8] also observed \nthat their patients did not display discomfort until swelling \nand dark patches on the earlobes were seen by the moth\u00ad\ners. As with our series, there was an absence of discharge or\nsystemic symptoms.\nIn our series, 5 patients (42%) were adults with type III \ninjuries, which corroborates the findings reported by Has\u00ad\nsen,[12] whose series included 24 cleft earlobe repairs and 11 \nadults who underwent procedures for complete clefts (46%).\nFigure 3.

Furthermore, adhe\u00ad\nsive earlobe support patches, made of transparent plastic \nand claimed to prevent earlobe stretching and tearing, are \ncommercially available; however, their effectiveness seems \nto lack supporting scientific evidence. All children in our \nseries underwent repair under general anaesthesia, with \nthe repair method being a combination of Pardue and Z-\nplasty, as described by Hamilton and LaRossa,[17] elimi\u00ad\nnating the need for subsequent ear-piercing. For patients \nwith thinned earlobes, multiple Z-plasties were employed, \nand ear piercing was performed at a later date. Patients \nwith type I cleft earlobes underwent Pardue repair.[16] The \noutcomes were satisfactory to the surgeons, patients, and \nparents, but all patients were lost to follow-up, preventing\nlong-term assessment.\nOne of the main complications of repiercing the earlobe \nis cleft recurrence, which we did not encounter in our series. \nThis aligns with the report by Lane and O\u2019Toole,[23] who \nalso noted a high rate of loss to follow-up.\nConclusions\nThe practice of ear piercing is common in Africa; however, \nto our knowledge, no previously published reports have de\u00ad\nscribed pressure necrosis as a complication affecting patients \nin Africa. Although ear piercing is predominantly performed \nby nonmedical professionals, it is crucial to establish guide\u00ad\nlines to prevent and mitigate the potential complications. The \nmechanisms underlying pressure necrosis warrant further in\u00ad\nvestigation, and parents should be educated to recognize early \nsymptoms to prevent earlobe clefts and other complications.\nAcknowledgements: We thank Prof. K.D.T.

The stan\u00ad\ndard treatment of choice is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt; however, complications associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt \nplacement have been documented in the literature. Herein, we present a rare case of distal shunt migration with associated \ncomplications.\nKeywords: hydrocephalus, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, hydrothorax, hydrocele, Tanzania\nIntroduction\nH\nydrocephalus is among the leading causes of hospital \nadmissions for infants in sub-Saharan Africa.[1]-[4] \nThe standard treatment of choice is the ventriculoperitoneal \nshunt (VPS), and the recent decade has seen the introduc\u00ad\ntion of endoscopic third ventriculostomy as an efficient al\u00ad\nternative in sub-Saharan Africa.[5] However, while VPS is \nthe most common procedure conducted in the management \nof hydrocephalus, there is growing scientific evidence that \ncomplications of VPS may occur anywhere along the surgi\u00ad\ncal tract, from the ventricular system to its blind destination \nwithin the peritoneal cavity.[6]-[12] Herein, we review a rare \ncase of double shunting, which was complicated by distal mi\u00ad\ngration; we discuss the course of management. Furthermore, \nconsonant with the clinical picture, we briefly review similar \ncases reported in the literature.\nCase presentation\nWe present the case of a 4-year-old boy who was admitted to \nour paediatric ward in September 2019 with a main complaint \nof severe respiratory distress for 4 days, which was associated \nwith fevers and generalized body weakness. The patient was \nnoted to have undergone a right-sided VPS procedure about \n6 months earlier, in February 2019, due to a nonfunctional \nleft-sided VPS that had been primarily placed in April 2018 \nfor the treatment of congenital communicating hydrocepha\u00ad\nlus, diagnosed via computed tomography (CT) when the pa\u00ad\ntient was 2 years old. Our review of the operative notes from \nthe previous procedures revealed no documented difficulties \nduring either of the VPS operations. Similarly, a review of \nthe past medical history, including admission notes and oral \nhistory obtained from the parents prior to the procedures, \nshowed no recorded evidence of hernia before shunting. The \npatient had been under post-VPS management at our insti\u00ad\ntution for 8 months prior to this admission, with a reported \nhistory of intermittent, painless scrotal swelling persisting for \nmore than 3 weeks. Upon admission, the child was tachyp\u00ad\nnoeic with chest indrawing and an oxygen saturation of \n90% on room air. He was febrile with a body temperature of \n37.9\u00a0\u00b0C, had a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, and had nor\u00ad\nmal capillary refill. He was irritable but remained conscious \nand responsive to verbal commands. A thorough physical ex\u00ad\namination revealed that the patient was notably underweight \nfor his age. He had bilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunts, \nboth palpable from the occipitoparietal points and trace\u00ad\nable along the trunk to the abdomen. The scrotum appeared \nswollen and was soft, mobile, retractable, and nontender.\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022\n149\njournal.cosecsa.org\nMwanza, Tanzania: Distal migration of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt\nCase Report\nInvestigations\nThe initial full blood count (FBC) indicated leukocytosis \nwith a predominance of neutrophils, and the malaria test re\u00ad\nturned negative. The electrolyte panel, liver function tests, \nkidney function tests, and urinalysis all fell within nor\u00ad\nmal ranges. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained \nfrom shunt tapping showed no abnormalities. A chest x-ray\n(Figure\u00a01) displayed bilateral pleural effusions, notably more \npronounced on the right side. Abdominopelvic ultrasonog\u00ad\nraphy detected a hydrocele and a potential right inguinal \nhernia, along with 2 VPS tubes present within the peritoneal \ncavity; the tip of the left-sided shunt was near the epigastric \nregion. Abdominal ultrasonography was conducted to pre\u00ad\ncisely locate the distal ends of both shunt catheters, and this \nrevealed the left-sided tip in the lower peritoneal area and \nthe right tip in the epigastric area, both demonstrating active \nCSF flow when the shunt valve was compressed\nDifferential diagnosis\nBased on the above investigations, we established provi\u00ad\nsional diagnoses of possible shunt migration to the pleural \ncavity, bacterial pneumonia with respiratory distress syn\u00ad\ndrome, and a hydrocele secondary to an inguinal hernia. \nDifferential diagnoses included shunt fracture, shunt over\u00ad\ndrainage, and aspiration pneumonia, among other causes of\nrespiratory distress.\nManagement\nThe patient received intravenous antipyretics and antibiotics \nand was placed on an oxygen mask, which led to improved \noxygen saturation and resolved his fever. Following a consul\u00ad\ntation, the cardiothoracic team placed a chest drain for the \nright-sided pleural effusion, resulting in improved dyspnoea \nover 5 days. Beta-2 transferrin, a marker for CSF, was detect\u00ad\ned in the sampled pleural fluid, supporting the diagnosis of \nCSF hydrothorax. The neurosurgical team was consulted and \nfound both shunt valves to be functional; however, the possi\u00ad\nbility of migration to the pleural space and shunt overdrain\u00ad\nage was considered. The decision to remove the right-sided \nshunt was made because of the suspected overdrainage from \nboth functioning shunts, a determination reached without \nthe benefit of a preoperative CT scan of the head. Intraop\u00ad\neratively, the distal portion of the left-sided shunt, which was \nsurgically truncated, was found near the pleura; however, no \ndefinite tract to the pleural cavity was identified. In the days \nfollowing shunt removal, there was a notable reduction in \nthe hydrocele and a progressive alleviation of the respira\u00ad\ntory distress. Further CSF analysis did not detect bacterial \ngrowth, effectively ruling out bacterial ventriculitis. A CT \nscan of the brain, performed 5 days after external ventricular \ndrainage, displayed ventriculomegaly indicative of increased \nintracranial pressure. This finding prompted the placement \nof a VPS, which was decided upon after a third consecutive \nnegative CSF culture result.\nOutcome and follow-up\nA chest x-ray performed 7 days after the chest drain inser\u00ad\ntion showed complete resolution of the pleural effusion. On \nthe first day following the VPS procedure, a control CT scan \nof the brain (Figure\u00a02) confirmed the shunt\u2019s correct place\u00ad\nment without evidence of increased intracranial pressure. \nNonetheless, 3 days after the procedure, the patient\u2019s mother \nobserved intermittent scrotal swelling, and the child\u2019s res\u00ad\npiratory distress returned, even while he was receiving high-\nflow oxygen therapy. The patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, \nFigure 1. Chest x-ray showing a bilateral pleural \neffusion on admission\nFigure 2.

The patient died within 7 days following the VPS \nprocedure, potentially due to severe pneumonia related to \nhydrothorax or aspiration pneumonia, compounded by pro\u00ad\nlonged immobilization. Shunt functionality was assessed \nand deemed operational, which discounted shunt failure as \na cause of death. Despite aggressive treatment with high-\ndose intravenous antibiotics and mechanical ventilation in \nthe intensive care unit, the patient succumbed to what was \npresumed to be severe pneumonia, characterized by severe \nrespiratory distress. An autopsy was not conducted to con\u00ad\nclusively determine the cause of death due to a lack of con\u00ad\nsent from the patient\u2019s family.\nDiscussion\nDistal shunt migration is among the most commonly re\u00ad\nported complications of VPS placement.[13]-[16] In this \narticle, we describe a patient with 2 simultaneous complica\u00ad\ntions of a VPS: left-sided distal migration into the pleural \nspace and distal migration into the scrotum, leading to hy\u00ad\ndrothorax and hydrocele, respectively. Several authors have \nidentified hydrothorax as a potential VPS complication, with \nvaried management outcomes in both paediatric and adult\npatients.[17]-[21] Martin et al.[17] suggest that intra-abdom\u00ad\ninal migration of the catheter through the right costoverte\u00ad\nbral trigone of Bochdalek could be the mechanism behind \nhydrothorax formation.[17] In our case, we hypothesize that \nthe truncated sharp end of the left-sided shunt inadvertently \npierced the pleura, permitting the free flow of CSF into the \npleural cavity and thus causing hydrothorax.\nFor the recurrent hydrocele observed in our patient, we \npropose that it was due to a congenital inguinal hernia that \nallowed positional leakage of CSF from the peritoneal cavity \ninto the scrotum. A case report by Paterson and Ferch de\u00ad\nscribes the effective resolution of a similar case of recurrent \nmigration via shortening of the distal catheter.[22] Nawaz et \nal.[23] adopted a different treatment strategy for a patient \nwith scrotal shunt migration, involving bilateral herniotomy, \nleft-sided orchidopexy, and repositioning of the VPS into \nthe peritoneal cavity in a 6-month-old with a recurring right \nhydrocele. Regrettably, in our case, the patient died from on\u00ad\ngoing respiratory distress before additional surgery could be \noffered to address the hernia.\nConclusions\nHydrothorax, although infrequent, is a potentially fatal com\u00ad\nplication of VPS surgery and must be considered in any pa\u00ad\ntient with a VPS presenting with severe respiratory distress. \nPrompt recognition and intervention of VPS migration, es\u00ad\npecially when it results in hydrothorax, are crucial to prevent \ndire outcomes. Additionally, recurrent hydrocele secondary \nto hernia formation typically necessitates surgical correction \nthrough herniotomy.

Within this category, perianal TB is particularly rare, \naccounting for under 1% of gastrointestinal TB cases. This report details the presentation and successful treatment of a 35-year-\nold man with a chronic perianal fistula yielding persistent purulent discharge, which a biopsy confirmed as secondary to TB. \nCombined surgical and pharmacological management led to a successful resolution. This case emphasizes the importance of \nincluding TB in the differential diagnosis for persistent, complex perianal fistulas, especially in settings where TB prevalence is high.\nKeywords: complex fistula in ano, tuberculosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, Ethiopia\nIntroduction\nT\nuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in \nAfrica.[1] Extrapulmonary presentations are infre\u00ad\nquent, with perianal TB constituting less than 1% of gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal TB cases. Perianal TB may be misidentified as \nother inflammatory or granulomatous diseases and typically \nnecessitates histological diagnosis and a high index of suspi\u00ad\ncion. There have been few case reports on the diagnosis and \nmanagement of perianal TB.\nCase presentation\nHistory\nA 35-year-old man presented with 2 months of persistent pu\u00ad\nrulent drainage from a perianal wound. He had undergone \n2 surgical interventions\u2014seton placement and fistulotomy\u2014\nwithin the previous 18 months. The first operation, conducted \nat a district hospital, did not include a biopsy. The second op\u00ad\neration involved the application of a seton to a fistulous tract \nand curettage of 2 draining sinuses, owing to the challenge \nof discerning the tracts\u2019 internal and external connections. \nFollow-up at our facility was inconsistent due to the patient \nmissing several appointments. Notably, the discharge contin\u00ad\nued unabated, with an additional fistulous tract developing, \nindicative of a lack of healing. The patient reported no altera\u00ad\ntion in bowel habits or abdominal discomfort and reported no \nsymptoms such as cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, or \nloss of appetite. He also had no history of prior TB treatment.\nPhysical examination\nHe had a blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 78 \nbeats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, \nand body temperature of 36.8\u00a0\u00b0C. Systemic examination did \nnot reveal any other abnormalities. The abdomen appeared \nflat and soft without organomegaly. Perianal examination re\u00ad\nvealed 4 pus-draining orifices and 1 healed scar (Figure 1). \nDigital rectal examination detected no masses; however, the \nperianal region was indurated, with palpable fibrous tracts \nforming a horseshoe pattern.\nDiagnostic investigations\nAbdominal ultrasonography and colonoscopy returned nor\u00ad\nmal results. HIV and diabetes mellitus tests were negative. A \nfull blood count and organ function tests were within nor\u00ad\nmal ranges. The chest x-ray showed no pathological findings.\nDifferential diagnosis\nThe complexity and refractory nature of the fistulas prompted \nus to consider several primary diagnostic possibilities: Crohn\u2019s \ndisease, complications from the use of traditional herbal rem\u00ad\nedies often applied for haemorrhoids or anal fissures in rural \nEthiopia, and TB. We promptly ruled out malignancy and other \ncommon risk factors, including radiotherapy. We also explored \nand excluded additional risk factors for chronic, nonhealing \nwounds, such as undiagnosed collagen vascular disorders and \nimmunosuppression from conditions like HIV or diabetes.\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022\n153\njournal.cosecsa.org\nHawassa, Ethiopia: Tuberculous fistula in ano in a 35-year-old man\nCase Report\nManagement\nConfronted with a complex, nonhealing fistula in ano, we \nperformed an anal examination under anaesthesia. The ex\u00ad\namination revealed 4 pus-draining external openings situ\u00ad\nated at the left lateral, posterior midline, right lateral, and \nright anterior positions, arranged in a horseshoe configura\u00ad\ntion. Primary openings were identified at the posterior mid\u00ad\nline and right lateral positions. The fistula tracts, following \na transsphincteric route, were curetted, and the tissue ob\u00ad\ntained was sent for histopathologic examination. A draining \nseton was placed (Figure 2).\nOutcome and follow-up\nThe patient exhibited a favourable postoperative recovery \nand was discharged after 2 days. One month later, the histo\u00ad\npathology results confirmed TB, characterized by granuloma \nformation and caseous necrosis (Figure 3, Figure 4). Draining \nsetons were replaced with nylon sutures (Figure 5), and anti-\nTB drug therapy was initiated. Subsequent follow-up showed \nsignificant improvement; within 2 months, the perianal area \nhad healed, allowing for the removal of the nylon seton.\nFigure 1.

Instances of perianal TB mimicking cancer \nare exceedingly rare.[11]\nIn some instances, perianal TB may resolve with anti-TB \ntreatment alone.[12] However, as previously discussed, a bi\u00ad\nopsy is generally necessary to confirm the diagnosis, often \nobtained through surgical intervention.\nConclusions\nTB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of non\u00ad\nhealing perianal fistulas, particularly in geographical regions \nwith high incidence rates. Combination drug therapy is cru\u00ad\ncial for effective treatment.\nDiscussion\nThis report describes a case of a chronic, nonhealing peri\u00ad\nanal fistula secondary to untreated TB, successfully managed \nwith surgical intervention and appropriate drug therapy.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, TB is the \nninth leading cause of death globally, and in 2017, there \nwere an estimated 1.3 million TB-related deaths among \nHIV-negative individuals and an additional 300\u00a0000 deaths \namong people living with HIV. In Africa, TB continues to \nbe a significant health challenge, with the World Health Or\u00ad\nganization reporting an estimated incidence of 25\u00a0900 cases \nin a population of 1\u00a0020\u00a0000 in 2016.[1] Ethiopia remains a \nhigh-TB-burden country, with an incidence rate of 164 per \n100\u00a0000 in 2017.[2]\nWhile the majority of TB cases affect the lungs, extrapul\u00ad\nmonary manifestations, including lymphadenitis, pleural, \nskeletal, meningeal, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal TB, \nare well recognized.[3] Gastrointestinal TB accounts for 1% \nof extrapulmonary TB cases[4] and may arise from the in\u00ad\ngestion of infected sputum, consumption of contaminated \nfood, haematogenous spread, or direct extension from ad\u00ad\njacent organs. The ileocaecal region is the most commonly \naffected area, presenting as strictures, obstruction, fistulas, \nor perforation, with lesions being ulcerative, hypertrophic, \nor a combination of both.[3] Perianal TB, accounting for \nless than 1% of gastrointestinal TB cases, is particularly \nrare. It predominantly occurs alongside active pulmonary \ndisease[5] and typically presents as haemorrhoids, perianal \nabscesses, or fistula in ano.[6] Nepomuceno et al.[7] iden\u00ad\ntified 4 types of perianal TB: ulcerative, verrucous, lupoid, \nand miliary, with ulcerative being the most common form, \noften secondary to pulmonary or intestinal lesions\u2014peria\u00ad\nnal disease is seldom primary.[7],[8] Anal fistula is the most \nfrequent manifestation of perianal TB,[9] and differentiating \ntuberculous fistulas from those with other causes requires \nhistologic or bacteriologic analysis. Crohn\u2019s disease is often \nconsidered in differential diagnoses due to symptomatic par\u00ad\nFigure 5. The setons were replaced by Nylon sutures.\nReferences\n1.\t World Health Organization.

The \nmanagement of older, frail patients with sigmoid volvulus and multiple comorbidities is challenging. Conservative treatment is \npreferred but is associated with a high recurrence rate.\nBased on insights from endemic regions, nonresectional surgical approaches are gaining traction. We propose a minimally inva\u00ad\nsive, nonresectional technique designed to mitigate the elevated risks associated with frail patients: laparoscopic plication and \nretroperitonealization of the sigmoid colon (PROSC).\nTwo older adults with extensive comorbidities underwent laparoscopic PROSC for persistent or recurrent sigmoid volvulus. There \nwere no procedural or postoperative complications. No recurrent volvulus, constipation, or infection was reported at a 12-month \nfollow-up evaluation.\nThese results show that laparoscopic PROSC could be an attractive and safe minimally invasive alternative technique for treating \nolder, frail patients with (recurrent) sigmoid volvulus. The technique may be a superior alternative for treating nongangrenous \nsigmoid volvulus.\nKeywords: sigmoid volvulus, recurrent volvulus, intestinal obstruction, sigmoidopexy, geriatric surgery, older adults,\nfrail patient, minimally invasive surgery, Netherlands\nTom Gresnigt1, Jorieke Nijhuis2, Pascal Steenvoorde2\n1Department of Surgery, Scheper Ziekenhuis, Emmen, the Netherlands\n2Department of Surgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands\nCorrespondence: Dr Jorieke Nijhuis (joriekenijhuis@gmail.com)\nIntroduction\nS\nigmoid volvulus is characterized by torsion of the sig\u00ad\nmoid colon around its central mesenteric axis, result\u00ad\ning in a closed-loop obstruction.[1],[2] It is the third lead\u00ad\ning cause of colonic obstruction (after colon cancer and \ncomplicated diverticulosis), as well as the leading cause of\nbowel strangulation.[3]\nSigmoid volvulus is common in Africa, the Middle East, \nIndia, Pakistan, Iran, and Russia but rare in Western popu\u00ad\nlations.[3]-[5] Treatment is often challenging because of its \nmain prevalence in older, institutionalized, or chronically \nconstipated patients, who often have pulmonary or cardio\u00ad\nvascular comorbidities and whose nutritional states are fre\u00ad\nquently suboptimal.[6]\nAlthough nonoperative decompression is the preferred \ntreatment modality, surgery is often warranted because of \nthe high recurrence rate.[1],[7]Additionally, long-term fol\u00ad\nlow-up has shown higher survival rates among surgically \ntreated patients with sigmoid volvulus than among those \nmanaged conservatively.[1]\nThere are numerous surgical options, such as Hartmann\u2019s \nprocedure, resection, and primary anastomosis or sigmoi\u00ad\ndopexy, but there is a significant risk of perioperative and \npostoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakage \nand, eventually, death, especially in frail patients.[8],[9]\nDrawing on insights gained from endemic regions, West\u00ad\nern medical practice is increasingly adopting nonresectional \nsurgical techniques.[8],[10],[11] These treatment approach\u00ad\nes offer enhanced safety and are particularly well suited for \npatients who are frail.\n156\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022\njournal.cosecsa.org\nLaparoscopic sigmoid colon plication and retroperitonealization\nCase Report\nWe present a minimally invasive nonresectional tech\u00ad\nnique suitable for frail or older patients with recurrent or \npersistent sigmoid volvulus: laparoscopic plication and ret\u00ad\nroperitonealization of the sigmoid colon (PROSC).\nCase presentations\nBetween September and December 2018, 2 patients were \ntreated for recurrent or persistent sigmoid volvulus at the \nDepartment of Surgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, a large \nreferral hospital in Enschede, the Netherlands.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from both patients \nbefore the interventions. The operations were performed by \nhighly experienced laparoscopic surgeons.\nPatients\nPatient 1, an 87-year-old White male with a past medi\u00ad\ncal history of Parkinson\u2019s disease, ileus, and recurrent sig\u00ad\nmoid volvulus (ASA [American Society of Anesthesiolo\u00ad\ngists] physical status class II), was admitted with intestinal \ncramps, constipation, and a distended abdomen. There were \nno signs of peritonitis. An abdominal x-ray showed a new \nepisode of sigmoid volvulus (Figure 1). Within 1 year, the pa\u00ad\ntient presented 3 times with recurrent sigmoid volvulus, for \nwhich detorsion and decompression were conducted each \ntime by endoscopic decompression and a rectal tube. Elec\u00ad\ntive surgery was scheduled, but the patient presented for a \nfourth time with sigmoid volvulus before the elective surgery\ncould be conducted.\nDetorsion and decompression were achieved by passage \nof a rectal tube once again, and subsequently, 3 days later, a \nlaparoscopic PROSC was performed.\nPatient 2, an 85-year-old White male with a past medical \nhistory of constipation and ileus (ASA class III), presented to \nthe emergency department with diarrhoea, (faecal) vomit\u00ad\ning, and a distended abdomen. There were no signs of perito\u00ad\nnitis. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a sigmoid \nvolvulus with an 11-cm dilatation.\nDetorsion and decompression were achieved by endo\u00ad\nscopic decompression and rectal tube insertion. Initially, the \npatient improved clinically, but his symptoms returned after \n3 days. Subsequent computed tomography revealed a recur\u00ad\nrent sigmoid volvulus (Figure 2). Laparoscopic PROSC was \nperformed on the same day.\nFigure 1. Abdominal x-ray revealing sigmoid \nvolvulus in patient 1\nSignificant distension of the sigmoid colon, measuring up to \n18 cm, is displayed as an arc (cranial view).

No significant \ndilation of the small intestinal loops, oedematous wall thicken\u00ad\ning, or pneumatosis intestinalis is evident in these images.\nA\nB\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 27 | NUMBER 4 | 2022\n157\njournal.cosecsa.org\nLaparoscopic sigmoid colon plication and retroperitonealization\nCase Report\nManagement: laparoscopic PROSC procedure\nThe patient is positioned in a modified lithotomy posi\u00ad\ntion with the legs supported by stirrups. The procedure is \nperformed with the surgeon standing on the right side\nof the patient.\nAccess to the peritoneal cavity is achieved by an open in\u00ad\ntroduction technique: a paraumbilical incision is made, and \na 10-mm trocar port is inserted, after which pneumoperito\u00ad\nneum (15 mmHg) is established. Two 5-mm ports are insert\u00ad\ned in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen under direct \nvisualization. If the colon is still distended, decompression \nis first achieved by inserting a rectal tube with proctoscopy.\nThen, the peritoneum must be dissected, lifting it off the \n(left) lateral abdominal wall, after which the sigmoid colon is \nmobilized retroperitoneally. The flaccid part of the sigmoid \nis placed retroperitoneally, and the peritoneal flap that has \nbeen raised is sutured to the antimesenteric taenia of the sig\u00ad\nmoid colon with barbed suture (Figure 3).\nAfter thorough inspection of the sigmoid and confirmation \nthat there are no complications, the trocars are removed un\u00ad\nder direct vision. Fascia is closed with 0-Vicryl sutures, and \nthe skin is intracutaneously closed with 4-0 Monocryl su\u00ad\ntures.\nThe rectal tube is left in situ for up to 4 days.\nOutcome and follow-up\nThere were no procedural or postoperative complications in \neither of the patients.\nFor patient 1, the time under anaesthesia was 66 minutes. \nHe had normal bowel movements on the second postop\u00ad\nerative day when oral intake was started. Patient 1 was dis\u00ad\ncharged on the fourth postoperative day.\nPatient 2 had a dolichosigmoid. Therefore, additional \nfixation of the tip of the dolichosigmoid with barbed su\u00ad\nture to the left subcostal abdominal wall was performed. \nThe time under anaesthesia was 52 minutes. He had normal \nbowel movements on the fourth postoperative day when oral \nintake was started. Patient 2 was discharged on the seventh \npostoperative day.\nAt respective 12-month postoperative follow-up visits, \nneither patient had experienced complications\u2014such as re\u00ad\ncurrent volvulus, constipation, or infection\u2014and none were \ndetected by our evaluations.\nDiscussion\nWith the ageing population in the Western world, coupled \nwith an increase in institutionalized patients and those with \nchronic constipation due to abundant opioid usage, a rise in \nthe prevalence of sigmoid volvulus is expected.\nManaging older, frail patients presents a challenge. While \nsurgery is the preferred option for preventing recurrence, \nas it is in younger patients, it also comes with a higher risk \nof perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly when \na sigmoid resection is performed.[2],[8],[9],[12] To miti\u00ad\ngate this risk, nonresectional operative procedures could\nbe considered.\nIn Malawi, where 1 of the authors previously worked, \nsigmoidopexy is the most common procedure used to treat \nnongangrenous volvulus, and it is associated with low recur\u00ad\nrence rates.[8] The principle of sigmoidopexy, used in this \nendemic region, is the foundation of laparoscopic PROSC, a \nminimally invasive alternative to sigmoidopexy.\nIt is important to use nonabsorbable sutures to minimize \nthe risk of recurrence. Studies have shown the use of absorb\u00ad\nable sutures to be associated with recurrent sigmoid volvu\u00ad\nlus, while recurrences have not yet been reported in associa\u00ad\ntion with the use of nonabsorbable sutures.[8]\nA major complication associated with fixation of \nthe sigmoid colon to the abdominal wall is internal\nherniation.[13] This risk is averted by the mobilization of the \nsigmoid colon retroperitoneally.\nAlthough plication is an old technique that has been \nsomewhat abandoned, the combination of minimally inva\u00ad\nsive plication with retroperitonealization of the colon is an \nattractive option for treating prefrail and frail patients.\nSuccessful results after nonresectional surgery have been \nreported widely.[1],[8],[10],[11] However, the most recent \nguidelines suggest that nonresectional operative procedures \nare inferior to sigmoid colectomy for the prevention of re\u00ad\ncurrent volvulus.[14] Percutaneous endoscopic colostomy \ntube insertion is suggested for high-risk patients who are \nunfit for surgery.[14] These recommendations, however, are \nbased on low-quality evidence.[15]\nAlthough laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic sigmoi\u00ad\ndopexy appears safer than standard percutaneous en\u00ad\ndoscopic colostomy tube insertion, the former is associ\u00ad\nated with significant complications, such as infection and \nfaecal leakage.[6],[10] These risks are minimized with\nlaparoscopic PROSC.\nIf the sigmoid colon is not gangrenous, and there is an \nincreased risk of anastomotic leakage, laparoscopic PROSC \ncould be an attractive and safe minimally invasive alternative \ntechnique that minimizes the risk of recurrence and anas\u00ad\ntomotic leakage.[11] As such, this procedure is particularly \nuseful in the management of older and frail or prefrail pa\u00ad\ntients, for whom sigmoid resection is a high-risk procedure. \nFigure 3.

Pelvic stress \nfractures constitute approximately 4% of all bone stress fractures. Athletes are particularly at risk for developing these types of \nfractures. Stress fractures of the pubic rami typically manifest as severe, progressively worsening pain in the groin area. A high \nindex of suspicion and comprehensive clinical examination are essential for accurate diagnosis. Advanced imaging modalities, \nsuch as magnetic resonance imaging, offer high sensitivity and can corroborate clinical findings. This report presents a case of a \nmisdiagnosed pubic ramus stress fracture in an athlete. We also review the relevant literature and discuss diagnostic approaches \nand treatment recommendations for such patients.\nKeywords: bone stress fracture, pelvic stress fracture, pubic ramus, sports injuries, Ethiopia\nMamo Deksisa1, Ananya Kassahun Admasu2, Moges Zenebe3\n1Sports Unit, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, St. Paul\u2019s Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n2Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia\n3Department of Radiology, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\nCorrespondence: Dr Ananya Kassahun Admasu (ananyakassahunmd@gmail.com)\nIntroduction\nP\nelvic stress fractures (PSFs) are relatively rare, account\u00ad\ning for only 4% of all bone stress fractures (BSFs). Stress \nfractures of the pubic rami are the most common PSFs, \nlargely attributable to the tensile force exerted by the strong \nadductor muscles at their pubic insertion. These fractures are \nfrequently observed in long-distance runners.[1] The typical \nclinical presentation of PSFs is groin pain, and such fractures \nmay not be evident on plain radiographs. Even repeated \nimaging findings may remain falsely negative.[2] More ad\u00ad\nvanced imaging modalities, such as computed tomography, \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scintigraphy, \nare often necessary for definitive diagnosis.\nGiven the relatively small number of reported cases \nworldwide, this specific case highlights the need for a height\u00ad\nened index of suspicion among treating clinicians for this \nrare injury; it also highlights the absence of a standardized \ntreatment protocol. We report a case of a pubic ramus stress \nfracture in a professional Ethiopian marathon runner.\nCase presentation\nA 25-year-old male professional marathon runner present\u00ad\ned with lower abdominal and groin pain, which had been \nprogressing over a span of 3 months by his estimation. He \nnoted a significant increase in pain during the 2 weeks pre\u00ad\nceding his presentation, which interfered with his training \nand daily activities. Despite seeking medical treatment, he \nexperienced no improvement in his symptoms. The patient \nhad no history of trauma, comorbid conditions, or chronic \nillnesses in the family. Additionally, he reported no history \nof smoking or alcohol consumption and had no other sites \nof pain. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness \nin the lower abdomen, inguinal area, and pubis, especially \nupon deep palpation. The only other significant finding was \npain on adduction against resistance on the right side.\nPSF was the leading differential diagnosis, followed by a \nfemoral neck stress fracture. The patient was subsequently \nreferred for imaging studies. Plain radiographs displayed an \nindeterminate lesion on the right pubic body and mild wid\u00ad\nening of the symphysis pubis. Due to the inconclusive nature \nof the radiograph, further imaging was ordered (Figure 1). \nAdditional MRI revealed a nondisplaced inferomedial frac\u00ad\nture of the right pubic body at the insertion of the common \naponeurosis of the rectus abdominis and adductor longus \nmuscles, as well as adjacent ill-defined bone marrow oedema \non the superior pubic ramus. There was also a partial tear of \nthe rectus abdominis\u2013adductor longus aponeurosis, accom\u00ad\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023\n43\njournal.cosecsa.org\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia: Pubic ramus stress fracture in a marathon runner\nCase Report\npanied by subchondral bone marrow oedema of the pubic \nsymphysis, consistent with pubic symphysitis (Figure 2).\nThe patient was treated conservatively through rest, an\u00ad\nalgesic medication, and supplementation with calcium and \nvitamin D. After 3 months of this regimen, he returned to \ntraining without pain.\nDiscussion\nBSFs arise from physiological, cyclical, repetitive, and con\u00ad\ntinuous muscular forces exerted on normal bones, leading to \nmicrotrauma that is inadequately remodelled.[3],[4] These \nfractures are commonly observed in otherwise healthy peo\u00ad\nple, such as military personnel and athletes. Frequent sites \nfor these fatigue fractures include the tibia, distal fibula, \nand metatarsals. BSFs can be categorized as high risk or \nlow risk based on their likelihood for progression, delayed\nunion, or nonunion.\nPSFs can be attributed to a variety of contributing fac\u00ad\ntors, both extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic factors include \nnutritional habits, type of terrain, and sports regimens, while \nintrinsic factors include anatomical variations, age, sex, eth\u00ad\nnicity, body mass index, bone mineral density, and physical \nfitness levels.[3] These factors often intersect in complex \nways.[5] For example, a case-control study conducted at \nan institutional sports injury clinic in South Africa in 1990 \nfound that athletes with BSFs were more likely than those \nwithout fractures to experience menstrual irregularities \n(P<0.005). That study also noted lower levels of dietary cal\u00ad\ncium intake in the fracture group (P=0.02).[6] Furthermore, \na randomized, double-blind study found that vitamin D and \ncalcium supplementation reduced the risk of fractures.[7] \nWomen are more prone to such injuries, as substantiated by \nmultiple studies, due to physiological factors like lower aero\u00ad\nFigure 2. Magnetic resonance imaging of the \npelvis, with (A) Axial PD fatsat (proton-density fat \nsaturation), (B) coronal STIR (short TI inversion \nrecovery), and (C) sagittal PD fatsat sequences\nThese images revealed a nondisplaced fracture of the right \ninferomedial pubic body at the insertion of the common \naponeurosis of the rectus abdominis and adductor longus mus\u00ad\ncles. Ill-defined bone marrow oedema was also evident at the \nadjacent superior public ramus. There was also a partial tear of \nthe rectus abdominis\u2013adductor longus aponeurosis, as well as \nsymphysis pubis subchondral bone marrow oedema, consistent \nwith symphysitis pubis.\nFigure 1. Anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis \nshowing an indeterminate lesion on the right pubic \nbody and mild widening of the symphysis pubis\n44\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023\njournal.cosecsa.org\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia: Pubic ramus stress fracture in a marathon runner\nCase Report\nbic capacity and smaller muscle mass.[8],[9] Additionally, \nthe incidence of BSFs increases with age.[10],[11]\nAmong athletes, stress fractures of the pubic rami near \nthe symphysis are the most common type of PSFs.[12] These \nfractures are typically not displaced, signifying a low likeli\u00ad\nhood of nonunion and fracture line progression. Common \nsymptoms include pain in the groin or thigh, as well as lower \nback and buttock discomfort.[5] Differential diagnoses for \ngroin pain include inguinal hernia, adductor muscle inju\u00ad\nry, osteitis pubis, pubic symphysitis, stress fractures of the \npubic ramus or femoral neck, femoral acetabular impinge\u00ad\nment, and hamstring injury.[8] It is crucial to differentiate \nthese from femoral neck stress fractures, which may present \nsimilarly but are categorized as high-risk fractures.[4] In \nthe context of a pubic ramus fracture, physical examination \ncommonly reveals tenderness over the affected ramus upon \ndeep palpation.[13] Pain may also be elicited when the pa\u00ad\ntient stands on a single leg on the affected side.[14]\nIn terms of diagnostic imaging, advanced modalities are \npreferable for identifying pubic ramus stress fractures, as is \nthe case for other PSFs. Plain radiographs, although readily \navailable, have low sensitivity\u2014about 10% within the first 2 \nto 3 weeks.[15] Computed tomography is not recommended \nas the first line of imaging because of its low sensitivity and \nassociated higher levels of radiation exposure. Bone scintig\u00ad\nraphy has high sensitivity but may yield false-positive results \nin the presence of a tumour or infection. MRI is the preferred \nmodality; despite limitations related to cost and accessibility, \nit offers the advantage of high sensitivity without the risk of \nradiation exposure.[14],[16]\nMRI is also employed for classifying BSFs. The Frederich \nclassification, originally developed for tibial stress fractures, \nhas been extended to categorize other types of BSFs. This \nsystem consists of 4 grades and is useful for distinguishing \nfractures as either high risk or low risk.[15]\nOur patient\u2019s plain radiograph yielded inconclusive find\u00ad\nings, which was consistent with existing literature. The de\u00ad\nfinitive diagnosis was established using MRI. It should be \nnoted that MRI for such injuries can reveal associated mus\u00ad\ncle contusions or injuries.[17] Our patient had sustained a \ntear in the common aponeurosis of the rectus abdominis and \nadductor longus muscles.\nThe treatment regimen for PSFs, generally considered \nlow-risk fractures, is usually relatively simple. The time \nframe for return to activity ranges from 7 to 12 weeks. Al\u00ad\nthough conservative treatment is most commonly employed, \nsurgical management may be considered based on the pa\u00ad\ntient\u2019s extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors. Addressing these \nrisk factors can enhance the rehabilitation plan and diminish \nthe likelihood of recurrence.[1],[13]\nA 2-phase rehabilitation protocol for conservative BSF \nmanagement in athletes has been proposed (Table).[18],[19] \nWhile these guidelines serve as a general framework, the \ntreating clinician should tailor the regimen based on the pa\u00ad\ntient\u2019s specific symptoms.[20] There is a knowledge gap con\u00ad\ncerning such treatment regimens in our context, making the \ntimeline for return to activity somewhat arbitrary.\nMoreover, it is crucial to adjust contributing intrinsic \nand extrinsic factors, which are patient dependent. Recom\u00ad\nmendations exist for the administration of 1500 to 2000 mg \nof calcium and 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D as preventive \nmeasures against stress fractures, although the supporting \nliterature is limited.[13],[21] Our patient received supple\u00ad\nmentation with both calcium and vitamin D.\nSummary and conclusions\nPSFs are uncommon but are more likely to be experienced \nby populations exposed to high levels of physical activity, \nsuch as athletes and military personnel. Our patient is a \nprofessional marathon runner who had been experiencing \npain for 3 months before presenting to our clinic. Despite \nprevious evaluations and the administration of analgesics \nfor pain management, his condition was undiagnosed. This \ncase underscores the need for orthopaedic surgeons to main\u00ad\ntain a high index of suspicion for PSFs in specific patient \npopulations. MRI is the preferred diagnostic modality for \nconfirming the clinical suspicion of PSFs. We acknowledge \nthat access to MRI may be limited in certain situations; in \nsuch cases, a thorough physical examination, coupled with a \ndetailed history and consideration of both extrinsic and in\u00ad\ntrinsic risk factors, may offer the best diagnostic approach. \nAdditionally, it is advisable to first rule out other more com\u00ad\nmon conditions and high-risk BSFs in the peripelvic region.\nIn conclusion, evaluating the prevalence and under\u00ad\nstanding of the associated extrinsic and intrinsic factors of \nPSFs and BSFs among athletes in our region would facili\u00ad\ntate the development of evidence-based treatment protocols. \nThese protocols would incorporate risk factor modification \nTable.

Initial surgery reduced the small bowel and pexyed the large bowel to \nthe right. The patient presented with obstructive symptoms 14 days after discharge, requiring a duodenojejunostomy to bypass \nan annular pancreas. Heterotaxy is a rare condition with variable anatomical presentations that may cause obstructive symp\u00ad\ntoms, often requiring surgical intervention.

Sherif (sherif@bcm.edu)\nIntroduction\nH\neterotaxy syndrome is a disorder of embryonic de\u00ad\nvelopment resulting in anomalous thoracoabdomi\u00ad\nnal organ determination of the left-right axis.[1] The clini\u00ad\ncal manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome include cardiac \nand extracardiac abnormalities.[2] Much of the literature on \nheterotaxy syndrome focuses on the cardiac sequelae, given \nthe potentially life-threatening nature of the cardiac defects \nand the potential need for immediate, complex medical and \nsurgical care.[3],[4] Extracardiac manifestations contribute \nsignificantly to morbidity and mortality and occur in a con\u00ad\nsiderable percentage of heterotaxy syndrome patients.[5] \nRecent publications concerning the extracardiac features of \nheterotaxy syndrome have attempted to further character\u00ad\nize the syndrome and prepare physicians for its treatment or \nsurgical management.\nA subset of the literature focuses on the intra-abdominal \nextracardiac manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome. This \nliterature has described asplenia, polysplenia, midline liver, \nextrahepatic biliary atresia and hypoplasia, pancreatic ab\u00ad\nnormalities, oesophageal atresia, hiatal and diaphragmatic \nhernias, right-sided stomach, bowel atresia, and malrotation \nof the intestine.[1],[6]-[9] These abdominal abnormalities \ncan be asymptomatic or present with obstructive symptoms, \noral intolerance, or abdominal discomfort. These symptoms \ndepend, in part, on the degree and type of anatomic abnor\u00ad\nmality. There is an active effort to characterize the appropri\u00ad\nate approaches for screening, operating, and managing the \nabdominal manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome.[10]-[12].\nWe report a case of heterotaxy syndrome that consisted \nexclusively of abdominal manifestations presenting as ob\u00ad\nstruction and requiring complex surgical care. This article \nreviews the presentation, management, and surgical consid\u00ad\nerations of abdominal heterotaxy syndrome in the context of \nintestinal obstruction.\nCase presentation\nInitial encounter\nA 3-year-and-5-month-old Malawian boy was referred to \nour tertiary care centre from a district hospital after 3 days \nof bilious, projectile emesis (approximately 6 episodes per \nday after oral intake), 4 days of obstipation, generalized ab\u00ad\ndominal pain, and abdominal distension. The patient was \nborn via uncomplicated, spontaneous vaginal delivery to \na 25-year-old mother who attended 5 antenatal care visits \nand took antenatal supplements and medications. He cried \nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023\n47\njournal.cosecsa.org\nLilongwe, Malawi: Abdominal heterotaxy syndrome\nCase Report\nupon delivery, was able to breastfeed shortly after delivery, \nand exhibited no birth defects. He went on to achieve normal \ndevelopmental milestones and receive all immunizations \non time. At 2 years and 8 months of age, he was admitted \nfor tonic-clonic seizures in the context of a severe malaria \ninfection. The child had not previously undergone any\nsurgical procedures.\nThe patient\u2019s family history was significant only for asth\u00ad\nma and hypertension.\nWhen the patient presented to this tertiary care centre, \nthere was no history of fever or jaundice. The patient was \nafebrile, tachycardic, and normotensive. On examination, \nhe was lethargic with muscle wasting (weight of 14 kg, \n25th percentile). His abdomen was distended with tender\u00ad\nness across all 4 quadrants. There was no rebound tender\u00ad\nness or guarding, bowel sounds were normal, and the rectal\nvault was empty.\nInitial management\nAfter resuscitation and nasogastric tube placement, he un\u00ad\nderwent an upright abdominal x-ray that revealed a distend\u00ad\ned, right-sided stomach with an air\u2013fluid level (Figure 1). \nThere were no echocardiographic abnormalities. The deci\u00ad\nsion was made to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy. \nThere were several pertinent intraoperative findings. These \nincluded an obstruction at the duodenojejunal junction sec\u00ad\nondary to adhesive bands, a proximal jejunal haematoma, \nan internal herniation of the small bowel behind the duo\u00ad\ndenum, a right-sided stomach, midline liver, and left-sided \ngallbladder (Figure 2). Extensive adhesiolysis was performed \nto release the bands, the small bowel was reduced, and the \nlarge bowel was pexyed to the right abdominal wall to restore \nits correct anatomic position. The patient\u2019s postoperative \ncourse was unremarkable, and he progressed appropriately, \ntolerating a diet after 24 hours and passing flatus on postop\u00ad\nerative day 4. Following this uneventful recovery, the patient \nwas discharged.\nSecond encounter\nAfter 14 days, the patient returned to the emergency de\u00ad\npartment with projectile, bilious emesis. The patient had \nbeen vomiting for 3 days (2-4 times per day after ingestion \nof food). The emesis was accompanied by severe left lower \nquadrant abdominal pain that was relieved by squatting. \nThe patient complained of constipation, averaging 1 stool\nevery 3 days.\nOn examination, he was alert and afebrile, with a nor\u00ad\nmal heart rate. However, his weight had dropped from 14 \nkg to 12.5 kg. His abdomen was slightly distended, soft, \nand nontender. The previous incision site had healed. His \nfull blood count and basic metabolic panel were notable for \nFigure 1. An erect x-ray revealed a right-sided \ngastric bubble, which was confirmed by nasogastric \nintubation.\nFigure 2. (A) A right-sided stomach and (B) adhesive \nbands were observed intraoperatively.\nA\nB\n48\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023\njournal.cosecsa.org\nLilongwe, Malawi: Abdominal heterotaxy syndrome\nCase Report\nanaemia (haemoglobin, 10.9 g/dL), hyponatraemia (sodi\u00ad\num, 125 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (potassium, 2.6 mmol/L), \nand hypochloraemia (chloride 76 mmol/L). An abdominal \nseries showed an enlarged right-sided gastric bubble and \nair\u2013fluid levels in the stomach (Figure 3). A contrast study \nraised concerns for a proximal small bowel obstruction, as \nthe contrast medium did not progress beyond the stomach\nafter 10 minutes.\nSecondary intervention\nThe patient underwent a second exploratory laparotomy, \nwhere the previously noted anatomical variants were noted \n(Figure 2), including an enlarged right-sided stomach, mid\u00ad\nline liver, left-sided gallbladder, and a left-sided duodenoje\u00ad\njunal junction with a broad mesentery. Additionally, a short\u00ad\nened large bowel, a small right spleen, and a right-positioned \npancreatic tail were observed. A significant finding during \nthis operation was the presence of an annular pancreas en\u00ad\ncircling and possibly obstructing the duodenum (Figure \n4). To address these issues, adhesions were lysed, and the \nshortened large bowel was repositioned to the right side of \nthe abdomen, with the caecum situated in the right upper \nquadrant. The procedure was completed with the construc\u00ad\ntion of a single-layer duodenojejunostomy using 4-0 PDS\n(polydioxanone sutures).\nOutcomes\nPostoperatively, the patient was admitted to the paediatric \nhigh-dependency unit. His immediate postoperative course \nwas characterized by poor urine output (<0.5 mL/kg/h) and \nsuboptimal oxygen saturation levels (approximately 80%). \nAfter 72 hours, oxygen saturation and urine output normal\u00ad\nized, and the child was transferred to the general ward. The \npatient received maintenance intravenous fluids for the first \n4 days, then started sips of oral rehydration solution. He pro\u00ad\ngressed to clear liquids and eventually a full diet. The child \nwas discharged with scheduled follow-up in the paediatric \nsurgery clinic. At the 2-month visit, the patient was doing \nwell and had gained weight.\nDiscussion\nIncreasingly, physicians are attempting to diagnose hetero\u00ad\ntaxy syndrome in the prenatal setting via ultrasonographic \ndetection and characterization of cardiac abnormalities.[13] \nEarly detection, in turn, assists in the appropriate provision \nof prenatal counselling and timely medical care during the \nneonatal period. However, there has been evidence that het\u00ad\nerotaxy syndrome may occur with exclusively abdominal \nFigure 3. An abdominal series demonstrated significant gastric distension.\nThe results at 0, 2, 5, and 10 minutes are pictured without any passage of contrast to the small bowel, suggesting a proximal obstruction.\nFigure 4. The patient\u2019s anatomic anomalies included \na midline liver, right-sided stomach, left-sided \ngallbladder, diminutive spleen, annular pancreas, \nadhesive bands, widened mesentery, and short \ncolon.\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023\n49\njournal.cosecsa.org\nLilongwe, Malawi: Abdominal heterotaxy syndrome\nCase Report\n5.\t Lim JS, McCrindle BW, Smallhorn JF, et al.

He exhibited only abdominal \nmanifestations of the syndrome, including an enlarged right-\nsided stomach, midline liver, left-sided gallbladder, left-sided \nduodenum, left-sided duodenojejunal junction, broad small \nbowel mesentery, shortened large bowel, small spleen, and \nsmall pancreas. Abdominal heterotaxy syndrome, therefore, \nrequires the paediatrician and the paediatric surgeon to be \nmindful of certain practice-based considerations.\nThese considerations may include basic changes, such as \nthe inclusion of heterotaxy syndrome in the differential di\u00ad\nagnosis when a patient presents with bowel obstruction, re\u00ad\ngardless of the age of presentation. However, more profound \nimplications exist. For example, exclusively abdominal \nmanifestations of heterotaxy syndrome in a resource-limited \nsetting may influence the time to diagnosis and early perfor\u00ad\nmance of surgical treatment. Antenatal ultrasonography may \nbe used as a screening tool to examine the abdominal organ \narrangement.[15] However, there is much debate around \nthe necessity of screening patients for abdominal manifesta\u00ad\ntions of heterotaxy and the subsequent decision to operate if \nany abnormalities are found.[12],[16]-[18] These choices in \nclinical practice are particularly important because, as illus\u00ad\ntrated by this case, heterotaxy syndrome can lead to multi\u00ad\nple sources of intra-abdominal bowel obstruction, including \nLadd\u2019s bands, annular pancreas, malrotation, and herniation \nof the bowel.\nConclusions\nHeterotaxy syndrome is a rare condition with a spectrum of \npresentations and anatomical variations. It is important for \nthe paediatrician and the paediatric surgeon to be mindful \nof the abdominal manifestations of heterotaxy syndrome as \nthey will guide their screening, surgical, and overall man\u00ad\nagement practices. These practice-based considerations are \nparticularly important given the multiple possible causes \nof bowel obstruction and the potential for recurrent pres\u00ad\nentations. Reoperation on these patients can be challeng\u00ad\ning, especially for surgeons not experienced with congenital\nbowel malposition.\nAcknowledgements: The authors thank Scott Holmes, CMI (Michael \nE.

Polyorchi\u00ad\ndism may be associated with a variety of complications, including malignancy.\nA 29-year-old man with a history of bone tuberculosis presented to our centre with a painless scrotal mass. The diagnosis of bilater\u00ad\nal polyorchidism with concurrent testicular tuberculosis was reached after comprehensive physical examination, imaging, biopsy, \nand exploratory surgery. The patient\u2019s testes were discovered to be in pairs, fused within both the right and left hemiscrotums. The \nmanagement strategy consisted of tuberculosis medication and regular follow-up.\nSupernumerary testes may be found within or outside the scrotum. Ultrasonography is the preferred diagnostic modality. In the \nabsence of complications or associated conditions, no further intervention is typically required. This case report expands our \nunderstanding of polyorchidism and outlines a comprehensive approach to patient management. Moreover, given the rarity of \nreported bilateral polyorchidism, this case provides further insights into this unusual medical condition.\nKeywords: polyorchidism, polyorchism, bilateral polyorchidism, supernumerary testes, testicular tuberculosis, Ethiopia\nIntroduction\nP\nolyorchidism (also called polyorchism) is a rare con\u00ad\ngenital anomaly characterized by the presence of 1 or \nmore supernumerary testes. Just over 200 cases have been \nreported in the literature, and most were asymptomatic and \ndiscovered incidentally.[1] Triorchidism is the most preva\u00ad\nlent form, with 4 and 5 testes previously reported in 10 and \na single patient, respectively, although the latter lacked his\u00ad\ntologic confirmation.[1] The additional testes are predomi\u00ad\nnantly found within the scrotum (75%), with the remainder \ndiscovered in the inguinal region (20%) or abdominally/ret\u00ad\nroperitoneally (5%).[1] We present a case of bilateral polyor\u00ad\nchidism in conjunction with testicular tuberculosis.\nCase presentation\nA 29-year-old man presented to our general medical hospi\u00ad\ntal in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with nontender bilateral scrotal \nswelling and a history of treated bone tuberculosis. Exami\u00ad\nnation revealed palpable testes of normal size and firm con\u00ad\nsistency in both the right and left hemiscrotums, with addi\u00ad\ntional, similarly sized and consistent masses also identified.\nUltrasonographic examination revealed hypoechoic \nhemiscrotal masses measuring 5.7 cm \u00d7 3 cm (right) and \n5.7 cm \u00d7 3.3 cm (left), following the epididymal outline and \nFigure 1. Ultrasonograms showing the right and \nleft testes in the right and left hemiscrotums, \nrespectively\nEAST and CENTRAL AFRICAN Journal of Surgery | VOLUME 28 | NUMBER 2 | 2023\n51\njournal.cosecsa.org\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia: Bilateral polyorchidism and testicular TB\nCase Report\ndisplaying peripheral calcific foci (Figure 1, Figure 2). Fine-\nneedle aspiration (FNA) cytologic examination confirmed \nthe masses as testes, characterized by ill-formed epithelioid \ncell granulomas. Acid-fast bacilli detected in the sample in\u00ad\ndicated tuberculosis infection.\nExploratory surgery through a midscrotal raphe incision \nrevealed 2 fused testes of identical size and shape, sharing \nthe same arteries, epididymis, and vas deferens within the \nright hemiscrotum (Figure 3). The left hemiscrotum was not \nexplored, and both testes were returned to the scrotum.\nAfter extensive physical examination, imaging, FNA cy\u00ad\ntologic examination, and an exploratory procedure, a diag\u00ad\nnosis of bilateral polyorchidism with testicular tuberculosis \nwas established. \nDiscussion\nPolyorchidism, defined as the presence of more than 2 tes\u00ad\ntes in 1 person, is a rare condition typically discovered in\u00ad\ncidentally in patients between 15 and 25 years of age during \nsurgery for cryptorchidism, testicular exploration, ingui\u00ad\nnal hernia, or testicular torsion.[2] The first histologically \nand surgically confirmed case was recorded by Arbuthnot\nLane in 1895].[3],[4]\nThe genesis of the testes occurs from the genital \nridge of the mesoderm, giving rise to the gonads, duct\u00ad\nal system, and primordial germ cells. In genetic males, \nthe TDF (testis-determining factor) triggers gender \ndetermination.[5] Also referred to as the SRY (sex-determin\u00ad\ning region of the Y chromosome), the TDF is located on the Y \nchromosome\u2019s short arm (Yp11). It transforms the primitive \ngonads into testes, which subsequently produce testosterone, \nprompting growth of the mesonephric (wolffian) ducts.[6] \nThe wolffian duct, a primordial urogenital tissue, contributes \nto the formation of the epididymides, vasa deferentia, semi\u00ad\nnal vesicles, and common ejaculatory duct following male\nsex determination.[7]\nAmong polyorchidism cases, triorchidism is the most \ncommon. The specific pathogenetic mechanisms under\u00ad\nlying polyorchidism remain elusive, but several theories \npropose mechanisms, including duplication of the geni\u00ad\ntal ridge, as well as longitudinal or transverse division of \nthe genital ridge. Leung and Singer have further suggested \na classification of embryologic polyorchidism based on\nembryologic differentiation [1]:\n\u2022\t\nType A: The supernumerary testis lacks an \nepididymis or vas deferens and is unattached to \nthe normally situated testes.\n\u2022\t\nType B: The supernumerary testis drains into \nthe epididymis of a normally situated testis and \nshares a common vas deferens.\n\u2022\t\nType C: The supernumerary testis has its own \nepididymis and vas deferens.\n\u2022\t\nType D: There is complete duplication of the tes\u00ad\ntes, epididymides, and vasa deferentia.\nAccording to this classification system, our patient had \nbilateral type B polyorchidism, with the additional testes at\u00ad\ntached together in both the right and left hemiscrotums and \nsharing common vasa deferentia, arterial supplies, and ve\u00ad\nnous drainage.\nMost people with polyorchidism present with painless \ntesticular masses. Associated anomalies commonly include \ncryptorchidism (40%), inguinal hernia (30%), hydrocoele \n(9%), and testicular malignancy (6%).[8] Our patient\u2019s FNA \nresults indicated testicular tuberculosis in the supernumer\u00ad\nary right and left testes.\nFigure 2. Ultrasonogram of the left scrotum with the \nleft testis and a hypoechoic adjacent mass\nFigure 3.

Regular ultrasonographic check-ups are recom\u00ad\nmended, with orchidopexy required for cryptorchidism and \norchiectomy for suspected malignancy.[10] Our patient was \ninitiated on a tuberculosis treatment regimen for the testicu\u00ad\nlar tuberculosis and scheduled for further follow-up, as all \ntestes appeared healthy.\nConclusions\nPolyorchidism is a rare congenital anomaly, with ultrasonog\u00ad\nraphy being the primary diagnostic tool. Magnetic resonance \nimaging may complement the diagnosis if needed. Gener\u00ad\nally, uncomplicated cases require no further treatment, but \npatients should undergo regular ultrasonographic follow-\nup. Any risk of malignancy necessitates the removal of ex\u00ad\ntra testes. For our patient, ultrasonographic and FNA biopsy \ninvestigations confirmed the diagnosis, and the patient was \nscheduled for follow-up. Given the rarity of bilateral poly\u00ad\norchidism (only 10 cases reported in the literature), our pa\u00ad\ntient\u2019s presentation and complications contribute to the body \nof knowledge on the topic, and this report serves as a valu\u00ad\nable reference point for comparing bilateral polyorchidism \nwith other possible presentations and manifestations.\nAcknowledgements: We would like to express gratitude to MCM \nComprehensive Specialized Hospital, Myungsung Medical College, and \nDr Hilkiah Suga for their support.\nReferences\n1.\t Cheng L, MacLennan GT, Bostwick DG.

Expression of hormone receptors and \nmolecular-subtyping is paramount in rationalizing prognosis and therapy. There exists significant variation in molecular status \nof breast cancer in SSA. We aimed to describe the receptor status and molecular subtypes of breast cancer at our centre. \nMethods \nWe conducted a retrospective study on patients with breast cancer enrolling for oncological care at our centre beginning May \n2018 to December 2021. \nResults \nWe included 345 patients with a median age of 49 years, 331 female and 14 males. The most common histological variant was \ninvasive-ductal -carcinoma of no-special-type from both biopsy (84.3%) and mastectomy specimens (82.8%). DCIS accounted \nfor only 2.9%. ER positive tumours accounted for 62.8% from biopsy and 66.7% from mastectomy specimens. The majority of \nthe female patients had luminal-type disease (Luminal A or B) with 65.2% from biopsy specimens and 67.3% from mastectomy \nspecimens. About 20% had TNBC. \nConclusion \nBreast cancer patients from Nakuru, Kenya, are likely to be young and with luminal-subtype invasive ductal carcinoma. \nIn contrast to some previous reports, less than a quarter of our patients have TNBC. We recommend prioritization, \nstandardization and scaling of receptor testing and molecular-subtyping to optimize treatment protocols and personalized \nmanagement strategies for breast cancer patients. \nIntroduction \nBreast cancer is the leading cancer, both in incidence and \nmortality, among women worldwide.1 It is also the second \ncommonest cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)2 \nAdditionally, while the incidence of breast cancer is on \nthe rise in SSA, the prognosis is poorer than in Western \ncountries.3 In Kenya, the incidence of breast cancer among \nwomen is the highest compared to other cancers.2 Breast \ncancer is treated based on the clinical, pathological and im\u00ad\nmunohistochemical characteristics of the tumours and the \noutcomes of breast cancer management depend on the clin\u00ad\nical and pathological stages of the tumour, nodal status, and \non the histological types.4 \nThe presentation, diagnosis and initiation of treatment \nof breast cancer in SSA is likely to be late due to innate \nchallenges in seeking, reaching, and accessing care.5 Breast \ncancer hormone receptor status is particularly useful for \npredicting the likely prognosis and tailoring treatment.6 Ad\u00ad\nditionally, the receptor status is paramount in determining \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

These recent improvements in the knowledge of \nbreast cancer have highlighted the importance of molecu\u00ad\nlar subtypes in its understanding and management. For ex\u00ad\nample, the luminal molecular subtypes (which stain posi\u00ad\ntive for oestrogen receptor) are commonly associated with \nbetter prognosis, globally.8,9,11 In addition, triple negative \nbreast cancer has been found to be common in younger fe\u00ad\nmale patients, to present with advanced disease and to have \na higher risk of recurrence and a poorer outcome.4,9 Brin\u00ad\nton and colleagues argue that majority of breast cancers in \nAfrica are likely to be hormone receptor negative and triple \nnegative subtypes.12 However, there exists a noteworthy \nvariation in the molecular status of breast cancer in SSA.1 \nFor example, Hawary et al showed predominance of lumi\u00ad\nnal A in a subset of Egyptian patients.11 Likewise, Sayed \net al found that in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital, the majority of \npatients seeking care for breast cancer had hormone recep\u00ad\ntor positive disease.13 Generalization on the basis of geog\u00ad\nraphy is therefore unpredictable. \nThere are no studies assessing the receptor status and/\nor molecular subtypes of breast cancers from our region. \nWe therefore conducted a descriptive study to determine \nthe pattern of receptor and molecular status of breast cancer \namong patients receiving care at our centre. The centre is \nthe region\u2019s principal referral hospital. \nMethods \nWe carried out a descriptive retrospective study at the \nNakuru Level 5 hospital\u2019s new oncology unit, in Kenya. \nThe hospital serves a catchment of 2.3 million people. We \nincluded all patients of all ages with or without a prior \nhistological diagnosis of breast cancer who were enrolled \nfor care as walk-ins or as referrals between May 2018 and \nDecember 2021. We excluded patients whose full records \ncould not be retrieved. \nPatient and disease particulars were retrieved from their \nrecords using a secure web-based questionnaire; this data \nwas collected as routine data at the point of initiation of \ncare. We collected data on patient demographics, tumour \nhistological type and receptor status. \nHormone receptor status was classified as positive \nwhere the pathology result read positive or where the Allred \nscore was 2 to 8.14 Her-2/Neu status was interpreted as fol\u00ad\nlows; score of 0 as negative, 1+ as negative, 2+ as equiv\u00ad\nocal and 3+ as positive according to the College of Amer\u00ad\nican Pathologists (CAP) guidelines.15 The receptor status \nwas used to assign a molecular subtype using the schema \nshown in table 1.16 Due to a foreseen challenge with un\u00ad\navailability of Ki-67 results from the majority of pathology \nreports, luminal A and B were not be specified and were in \neffect classified as a \u2018Luminal cancers\u2019 \nTable 1.

The most common histological vari\u00ad\nant was invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC) \nfrom both the biopsy (84.3%, n=236 of 280) and mastec\u00ad\ntomy specimens (82.8%, n=125 of 151). DCIS accounted \nfor only 2.9% (n=8) of biopsy specimens and 0.7% (n=1) of \nthe histology from mastectomy specimens.

Only 29 patients had ER, PR, and HER2 status \ndata available from both their biopsy and surgical speci\u00ad\nmens. In respect to the patients whose IHC results were \navailable, ER positive tumours accounted for 62.8% (n=125 \nof 199) from biopsy and 66.7% (n=74 of 111) from mastec\u00ad\ntomy specimens. The results for Her2 receptors and Ki-67 \nindex are demonstrated in table 3 above. (Distribution of \nthe receptor status among gender and age groups is avail\u00ad\nable as a supplementary file). \nMolecular status \nThe majority of the female patients had luminal type dis\u00ad\nease (Luminal A or B) with 65.2% from biopsy specimens \nand 67.3% (n=76 of 113) from mastectomy specimens. As \nshown in table 4 below, majority of the patients with lumi\u00ad\nnal type disease were below 50 years of age. None of the \nmale patients had triple negative disease but 22.0% (n=42 \nof 191) of female IHC from biopsy and 21.1% (n=23 of \n109) from mastectomy were triple negative subtype. \nDiscussion \nOur study demonstrated that breast cancer patients from \nour centre are likely to be young (below 50 years of age) \nand with luminal subtype invasive ductal carcinoma. Less \nthan a quarter of our patients had triple negative disease. \nThe characterization of receptor status and determination of \nthe molecular subtype of breast cancer is paramount in the \nchoice of therapy and determining prognosis.1 An impor\u00ad\ntant limitation of our study was the limited number of mas\u00ad\ntectomy specimens submitted for IHC staining even in the \nface of probable discrepancies between preoperative biopsy \nIHC and IHC from surgical specimens. This was likely due \nto low level of awareness on utility of receptor and molecu\u00ad\nlar typing after surgery and/or financial constraints. \nSeveral authors have previously argued that breast can\u00ad\ncer, specifically Luminal A cancer, is expected to be com\u00ad\nmon in postmenopausal women.17,18 For example, in Nige\u00ad\nria, ER positive tumours were shown to be more prevalent \nin women older than 50 years.19 However, there are nu\u00ad\nmerous conflicting reports from our region that cite that \nthe majority of patients diagnosed with breast cancer are \nyoung and likely to be below 50 years of age. This has pre\u00ad\nviously been demonstrated by reports from Africa1,13,20 In \nour study, the median age was 49. In fact, the majority of \nthe patients with ER positive disease were below 50 years \nof age. Sally et al argue that the observed prevalence in pre-\nmenopausal age group is likely due to a generally low me\u00ad\ndian age in the African population.21 However, this finding \nmay implicate reproductive risk factors and suggest a bio\u00ad\nlogical basis of the early breast cancer in our population.20 \nLastly, only 1.5% of our patients were above 80 years. This \npossibly suggests life expectancy and/or survival and might \nnot be an actual reflection of breast cancer incidence in this \nage group from our region. \nThe most commonly treated histological variant of \nbreast cancer in our region is invasive ductal carcinoma \n(IDC) of no special type.1,21,22 This corroborates with our \nfindings and those of other authors from Kenya who re\u00ad\nported rates of 84 to 90% from their series.13,23 Marianne \net al reported that 87% of their patients from Tanzania had \nIDC which is comparable to 82.3% reported from Nige\u00ad\nria by Adebamowo and colleagues.1,19 In addition, only \n2.9% of our patients had DCIS. This is likely due to the ab\u00ad\nsence of a screening program in our region, but may also \nbe a reflection of the health-seeking behaviour of the tar\u00ad\nget population. Similar findings have been reported from a \n7 years retrospective review of an unscreened population \nfrom South Africa, citing a rate of 1.1% for DCIS; this is \nin contrast to settings with elaborate screening programs \nwhere cancers are likely to be diagnosed at an earlier \nstage.18 \nMolecular Subtypes of Receptor-defined Breast Cancer from Nakuru, Kenya\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n37\nTable 3.

A recent systematic review on receptor-de\u00ad\nfined subtypes of breast cancer in indigenous populations \nin Africa established that the majority of breast cancers \nare hormone receptor positive, specifically ER positive.25 \nWhile some authors clearly dispute existence of a real dif\u00ad\nference in hormone receptor status of Africans compared to \nother populations, Sayed et al argue that any perceived dif\u00ad\nference is likely multifactorial.13,18,19 It is therefore postu\u00ad\nlated that adjusting for differences in age and other techni\u00ad\ncal factors in handling of IHC specimens could account for \nany perceived differences in hormone receptor status be\u00ad\ntween Africans and their matched cohorts from other geo\u00ad\ngraphies.12 \nHER2 status is important in the choice of treatment, \nespecially adjuvant chemotherapy, and in prognostication. \nMost breast cancers in Africa are however known not to ex\u00ad\npress HER2 receptors.12 Our study showed that only a third \nof our patients expressed HER2. Likewise, the Ki-67 in\u00ad\ndex is pivotal in prognostication and is also a component in \nthe assignment of molecular subtype (as shown from table \n1).7,16,26 In our study, majority of the patients did not have \nKi-67 index results. While this could be due to challenges \nin tissue processing and inability to apply advanced IHC \ntechniques, it was probably due to cost restraints (as its test\u00ad\ning is costed separately) and/or low level of awareness on \nthe utility of Ki-67 index among members of the healthcare \nteam at our centre. This subsequently limited our ability to \ndifferentiate luminal A from luminal B disease. \nSeveral previous reports have argued that breast cancer \nin our region is predominantly triple negative subtype.18,\n23 In contrast, we have found that the majority are in fact \nthe luminal subtype (luminal A and B), with triple negative \ndisease accounting for only 21.2% of diagnoses made from \nbiopsy and 20.4% from mastectomy specimens. Our find\u00ad\nings are in agreement with those of authors from Kenya, \nTanzania and South Africa.1,13,24,27 Likewise, most tu\u00ad\nmours from a Nigerian series were of luminal subtype.19 As \npreviously stated, it is likely that the molecular subtypes of \nbreast cancer in Africa, e.g. triple negative breast cancer, \nis similar to that in other regions. However, since differ\u00ad\nences could exist even within a population, genetic vari\u00ad\nabilities and/or selection biases could account for the previ\u00ad\nous reports that found a higher prevalence of triple negative \ndisease, in East Africa for example.13,17,23 Bird and col\u00ad\nleagues recommend genetic racial detailing to investigate \nfor interracial heterogeneity in molecular subtypes of breast \ncancer.24 \nThis is the first study describing molecular and receptor \nstatus of breast cancers in Nakuru. From our results, major\u00ad\nity of cancers in our centre are likely to be invasive ductal \ncarcinoma, expressing hormone receptor status and of lumi\u00ad\nnal molecular subtype. Importantly, we recognize the like\u00ad\nlihood of significant heterogeneity in receptor status and \nmolecular subtypes that could exist even within our own \npopulation.18 We therefore agree with other authors that \navailability of receptor testing and molecular subtype deter\u00ad\nmination should be prioritized and that testing and interpre\u00ad\ntation of these results should be standardized.13,25 This will \nallow the conduct of better quality studies enabling age-\nmatching, disease type (molecular subtype) matching and \nprobably even treatment matched so as realize the delivery \nof biology-specific personalized care within our oncologi\u00ad\ncal care systems. \nLimitations \nOur study had several limitations. First, the study design \nwas retrospective- therefore likely to suffer from several \npotential biases, confounders and missing data. Designing \nbetter and prospective future studies can possibly help \navoid/reduce these sources of bias. Secondly, we were un\u00ad\nable to report on luminal A and luminal B disease subtypes \nseparately due to the prominently missing data on Ki-67 in\u00ad\ndex. Sensitization of care givers on the importance and util\u00ad\nity of Ki-67 in the treatment of breast cancer should be pri\u00ad\noritized. Thirdly, our study was conducted from a single \ncentre and the IHC testing was not standardized (in most \ninstances were done from different labs). This possibly im\u00ad\npacts on the reproducibility and generalizability of our find\u00ad\nings. Nevertheless, we opine that our findings on molecular \nsubtypes of breast cancers in our centre improves our cur\u00ad\nrent understanding of molecular subtypes of breast cancers \nin our region and will form the ground work for better de\u00ad\nsigned studies. \nConclusion \nBreast cancer patients from Nakuru, Kenya, are likely to be \nyoung and with luminal-subtype invasive ductal carcinoma. \nIn contrast to some previous reports, less than a quarter of \nour patients have triple negative breast cancer. We recom\u00ad\nmend prioritization, standardization and scaling of receptor \ntesting and molecular subtyping to optimize treatment pro\u00ad\ntocols and personalized management strategies for breast \ncancer patients. \nSubmitted: October 24, 2022 EAT, Accepted: July 02, \n2024 EAT \nMolecular Subtypes of Receptor-defined Breast Cancer from Nakuru, Kenya\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n39\nReferences \n1.

National Surgical Obstetric and \nAnesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) emerged as crucial national policy frameworks to address this gap. Although some Sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries have developed and launched NSOAPs, there is limited information on evaluation of the progress and \neffectiveness of these plans. This study aimed to assess progress and challenges in implementing Tanzania\u2019s NSOAP. \nMethodology \nWe sent an electronic survey to all 26 Regional Health Management Teams (RHMTs) in mainland Tanzania to record their \ninsights and understanding of the NSOAP and the state of Surgical Obstetric and Anesthesia (SOA). The RHMTs are key \nstakeholders in the NSOAP implementation as they oversee day-to-day implementation of all health interventions at the \nregional level. \nResults \nOnly 4% of the surveyed RHMTs reported participating in the NSOAP development process, and 58% were unaware of the \npolicy. The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist was rarely used, and surgical outreach programs were non-existent. There were \ngaps in the availability of SOA equipment and lack of radiological, intensive care and biomedical services. SOA specialists were \nfew (1.96 specialists per 100,000 population). Most regions were excluded during the NSOAP dissemination meetings with no \ndedicated NSOAP coordinators at the regional level. \nConclusion \nThe NSOAP implementation faced various challenges in service delivery, infrastructure, equipment, human resources, \ninformation management and governance. Although slow progress has been made, there is a need for concerted efforts to \nachieve the NSOAP objectives. Future research should focus on comprehensive NSOAP evaluation and the establishment of \nan effective monitoring and evaluation framework. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe 2015 report by Lancet Commission on Global Surgery \nhighlighted significant disparities in access to safe and af\u00ad\nfordable surgical, obstetric, and anesthesia (SOA) services \nglobally.1 Notably, it showed that over 90% of the popu\u00ad\nlation in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) lacked \naccess to safe, timely, and affordable SOA services. To ad\u00ad\ndress this burden, countries were advised to prioritize SOA \nservices through the development of National Surgical Ob\u00ad\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(2):15-22. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.4\nstetric and Anesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) as part of their na\u00ad\ntional health plans.2 \nIn recent years, there has been considerable progress \nin sub-Saharan Africa, with several countries, including \nEthiopia, Zambia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Nigeria \ndeveloping NSOAPs.2 These efforts aim to fulfil the 2015 \nWorld Health Assembly Resolution 68.153 to strengthen \nemergency and essential surgical care as part of Universal \nHealth Coverage and the sustainable development goals. \nHowever, there has been limited evaluation of the imple\u00ad\nmentation status of these plans. We found one evaluation \nreport for the 5-year implementation of the Ethiopia Surgi\u00ad\ncal plan4 but could not locate any mid-term or other evalu\u00ad\nation reports for NSOAPs elsewhere. \nThe United Republic of Tanzania was among the first \ncountries to develop and launch a comprehensive NSOAP \nin 2018, with support from the GE Foundation, and the Safe \nSurgery 2020 consortium. The Tanzania NSOAP5 spans a \ntimeframe of 2018-2025 and focuses on several objectives \nfor improving access to SOA services through strengthen\u00ad\ning the provision of care, training more SOA providers, \nenhancing referral pathways for emergency and essential \nsurgical care, improving infrastructure and equipment, en\u00ad\nhancing data management systems, and advocating for re\u00ad\nsources to support surgical care.6 \nThis study sought to assess the NSOAP implementation \nstatus aiming at understanding the achievements and chal\u00ad\nlenges specifically at the implementation level i.e. the re\u00ad\ngional level, with the aim of addressing the challenges. Al\u00ad\nthough the survey tool was not constructed to specifically \nassess each NSOAP objective, it aimed at assessing the Re\u00ad\ngional Health Authorities understanding of the NSOAP and \ngather their views on the implementation of the plan and the \ngeneral status of SOA services in their respective regions. \nTo advocate for this plan, there is a need to understand \nthe current extent of implementation, enabling and inhibit\u00ad\ning factors, steps needed to realize the 2025 target and spe\u00ad\ncific recommendations for future improvement. \nMETHODOLOGY \nStudy area \nTanzania has 26 Regional Health Management Teams \n(RHMTs) composed of the Regional Medical Officer \n(RMO), Regional Health Secretary, Regional Reproductive \nChild Health Coordinator, and other departmental man\u00ad\nagers within the region. The RHMT oversees health ac\u00ad\ntivities within their regions including SOA services. The \nNSOAP was designed to be implemented by RHMTs, \nhence the expectation that they understand its deliverables. \nDesign \nWe carried out a cross-sectional quantitative study using \nconvenience sampling to collect insights through an elec\u00ad\ntronic survey sent to key stakeholders involved in the plan\u00ad\nning and implementation of SOA services at regional and \ndistrict levels. Each RHMT was asked to complete one sur\u00ad\nvey tool to describe the status of SOA services in the region \nfrom the survey questions. All regions in mainland Tanza\u00ad\nnia were included in the survey. \nData Collection Methods \nWe distributed an electronic survey to RHMTs in March \n2022 (4 years post-NSOAP launch). The survey tool was \norganized around the NSOAP objectives: service delivery, \nreferral systems, information management, support ser\u00ad\nvices, and the number of available SOA specialists. The \nsurvey consisted of closed-ended questions. \nThe electronic link to the survey was sent to the Re\u00ad\ngional Medical Officer in each region, and the interviewer \nfollowed up with a phone call to ensure that questions \nwere clear to the respondents and the survey was completed \ntimely. We also involved the officials from the President\u2019s \nOffice Regional Authority and Local Government Author\u00ad\nity (PORALG) in this assessment since they oversee imple\u00ad\nmentation of health programs at the regional level and were \ninstrumental in ensuring each region responded to this sur\u00ad\nvey. \nData Analysis \nWe conducted descriptive data analysis and summarized \nthe findings as appropriate using Microsoft Excel. No sta\u00ad\ntistical tests were performed. The findings from the survey \nwere categorized into key NSOAP domains i.e., service de\u00ad\nlivery, infrastructure and equipment, human resources, in\u00ad\nformation management, finance, and governance. \nRESULTS \nWe sent an electronic survey to all RHMTs in all 26 regions \nof Mainland Tanzania to gather information on provision \nof SOA services at the regional/district levels. Each re\u00ad\ngional team completed one questionnaire. All 26 regions re\u00ad\nsponded to the survey. The Regional Medical Officer is the \nresponsible officer for the RHMT with mandate to guide \ndecisions, but the team is composed of other members in\u00ad\ncluding Regional Health Secretary, Regional Reproductive \nChild Health Coordinator, Regional Dentist, Regional Phar\u00ad\nmacist, Regional Laboratory Officer, and other heads of \nDepartments at the regional level. The distribution of the \nrespondents and their roles in the RHMT is summarized in \nTable 1. \nKnowledge of NSOAP policy \nWhen asked about their awareness of the NSOAP, 15 \n(58%) of the 26 RHMTs were not aware of its existence and \nonly 1 (4%) of the interviewed RHMT acknowledged that \nthey were involved during NSOAP planning in 2018. \nAn Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n16\nTable 1.

Only 2 (8%) of the RHMTs re\u00ad\nported having an established outreach program in all district \ncouncils. \nSurgical equipment and supplies \nWhen asked about the proportion of SOA facilities \nequipped with the necessary equipment, only 9 (35%) of \nthe 26 RHMTs stated that all or more than half of the SOA \nfacilities in their regions possess all the necessary equip\u00ad\nment to provide services. 24, (92%) of the respondents re\u00ad\nported lack of a fully functional radiology department. All \n26 RHMTs (100%) indicated that either less than half or \nnone of the SOA facilities had a functional Intensive Care \nUnit (ICU). Only 3 (12%) of the RHMTs reported that all \nor more than half of their facilities have access to biomed\u00ad\nical equipment engineering technicians\u2019 (BMET) services. \nSOA Service Providers working at the \nregional level \nThe Tanzanian NSOAP aims to increase the specialist SOA \ndensity from 0.46 per 100,000 population in 2017 to 2.27 \nper 100,000 population by 2025. According to Data from \nthe Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT),7 there were \n1,199 SOA specialists in Tanzania, translating to 1.96 SOA \nproviders per 100,000 population (Table 1). In this survey, \nwe recorded 297 SOA specialists working at the regional \nlevel (Figure 1). Majority were Obstetricians (43%) and \nGeneral Surgeons (21.3%). This number excludes SOA \nproviders at national and tertiary referral hospitals. Seven \nout of the 26 regions reported presence of anesthesiologists \nworking at the regional level. About a quarter (27%) of \nthe respondents reported availability of SOA training pro\u00ad\ngrams in their regions. Since there was no baseline assess\u00ad\nment conducted prior to the NSOAP launch, it is difficult \nto interpret whether these numbers have improved, or not. \nWe correlated this data with the number of SOA special\u00ad\nists recorded in the Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT) \ndatabase. The number from the survey captures the SOA \nspecialists working at the regional level specifically in the \npublic sector, while the MCT numbers include specialists at \ntertiary hospitals and in the private sector. The total num\u00ad\nber of SOA specialists in the MCT database is referenced in \nTable 2. \nGovernance \nOnly 7 out of the 26 RHMTs interviewed (27%) reported \ninclusion of SOA activities in their Comprehensive Council \nHealth Plans (CCHPs). Only 3 of the 26 RHMTs (12%) \nwere involved in NSOAP dissemination meetings and also \n3 of the RHMTs interviewed (12%) had appointed a dedi\u00ad\ncated NSOAP coordinator at the regional level. \nDISCUSSION \nThe Tanzania MOH launched the NSOAP in 2018 aiming \nto systematically strengthen SOA care in Tanzania over \nAn Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n17\nFigure 1. Number of reported SOA specialists working in the 26 regions of Mainland Tanzania \nThere were 297 SOA specialists working in the regions. Majority of them were Obstetricians (43.0%) followed by General Surgeons (21.3%) \nseven years. This study represents the first national assess\u00ad\nment of this policy document. \nRegarding SOA service delivery, the survey highlighted \ngaps in service provision at the district level. Referral sys\u00ad\ntems were found to need strengthening and this was similar \nto findings in other LMICs emphasizing the need to \nstrengthen this area.8 \nReducing maternal mortality is a key priority of the \nTanzanian NSOAP. Availability of CEmONC services was \nlimited, with a low percentage of health centers offering a \nfull range of services, including c-section and blood trans\u00ad\nfusion services. Previous studies in Tanzania and elsewhere \nshowed similar gaps, demonstrating a need for more fo\u00ad\ncused efforts to improve SOA services.9 Although there \nwas an overall increase in the number of health facilities, \nshortages in critical services such as anesthesia and critical \ncare persisted as previously.9 \nAccording to MCT data7 there was an increase in the \nnumber of SOA specialists (Table 2) (1.96 per 100,000 pop\u00ad\nulation) compared to 0.46 per 100,000 population when \nthe NSOAP was launched,6 possibly due to new graduates \nfrom the ongoing scale-up of post-graduate programs in \nvarious medical schools, but the density remained low com\u00ad\npared to the Lancet Commission standards (20 SOA \nProviders per 100,000 population.1 However, these results \nmay not necessarily reflect the targets set during the \nNSOAP launch.5 Fewer of these specialists were working \nat the regional level (Figure 1). \nThe low awareness level of the NSOAP among the re\u00ad\nspondents is concerning, highlighting the need for enhanced \nefforts in NSOAP dissemination to key stakeholders. With\u00ad\nout adequate awareness, it is challenging to align the \nNSOAP objectives with the regional plans. The limited par\u00ad\nticipation of RHMT members in the NSOAP development \nprocess raises questions about the inclusivity of stakehold\u00ad\ners in shaping the plan. Active involvement and collabora\u00ad\ntion among key decision-makers at the regional level are \nessential for the effective implementation and sustainabil\u00ad\nity of services. The lack of a governance structure at the re\u00ad\ngional level, as exampled by the absence of NSOAP coor\u00ad\ndinators is a significant barrier to the implementation of this \nplan. \nThe availability of dedicated ambulance services in most \ndistrict councils is encouraging, but there is a need to ensure \nconsistent access and optimal utilization of these services. \nThis includes addressing challenges such as infrastructure, \nresources, and coordination between ambulance services \nand healthcare facilities, as reported in a similar setting in \nMalawi.8 \nThe WHO surgical safety checklist is recommended by \nthe WHO to improve surgical quality and outcomes. The \nlow utilization of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist high\u00ad\nlights a critical patient safety concern. Efforts should be \ndirected toward promoting the widespread implementation \nand consistent use of the checklist across SOA facilities. To \nimprove access and equity in surgical care, it is essential to \nstrengthen surgical outreach programs, address infrastruc\u00ad\nture gaps, and ensure the availability of appropriate equip\u00ad\nment and supplies in all facilities providing SOA services. \nThese best practices have been implemented in some set\u00ad\ntings in Tanzania as evidenced by the Safe Surgery Pro\u00ad\nject10\u201112 calling for country-wide scale-up of such inter\u00ad\nAn Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n18\nTable 2.

The findings regarding the functional radiology \ndepartments, laboratories, and intensive care units in SOA \nfacilities indicate areas of concern with a need of ensuring \navailability of these critical components in promoting qual\u00ad\nity and safety of surgical procedures, as highlighted in one \nstudy in a similar low-resource setting.13 \nThe low-density ratio of SOA providers and the limited \npresence of anesthesiologists at the regional level highlights \nthe need for strengthening the workforce capacity. Increas\u00ad\ning the number of SOA specialists and ensuring their dis\u00ad\ntribution across regions is essential in improving the deliv\u00ad\nery of safe services. The low percentage of SOA training \nprograms indicates the need for greater emphasis on train\u00ad\ning and integration of SOA services at the regional level, as \nrecommended in the NSOAP. \nThe limited involvement of regions in NSOAP dissem\u00ad\nination and lack of dedicated NSOAP coordinators within \nthe Ministry of Health raised concerns about the coordina\u00ad\ntion and implementation of the plan at the regional level. \nEffective communication, coordination, and leadership are \ncrucial for the successful execution of the NSOAP. It is im\u00ad\nportant to follow the NSOAP development framework and \npay attention to the key barriers in the translation of policy \nto practice.14,15 \nStudy Limitations \nDue to limited time and resources, we could not use more \ninteractive approaches such as focused group discussions, \ndirect observations, or field visits. In addition, published lit\u00ad\nerature might be subject to bias, may not cover the latest \ndevelopments, and might not capture the full range of per\u00ad\nspectives. As with many large-scale policy projects, it is \nchallenging to attribute improvements in SOA services ex\u00ad\nclusively to NSOAP implementation since the NSOAP \nmonitoring and evaluation framework had not been estab\u00ad\nlished. Furthermore, patient and community perspectives \non the status of SOA services were not included and we did \nnot also assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in \ndelaying the plan implementation. \nCONCLUSION \nFindings from this analysis revealed important insights into \nthe current state of SOA services and the implementation of \nthe NSOAP in Tanzania. \nThe findings highlight areas of strength and areas that \nrequire targeted interventions for improvement. To achieve \nthe goals outlined in the NSOAP and enhance the overall \nquality and accessibility of SOA services, concerted efforts \nare needed at both the national and regional levels. Collab\u00ad\noration, capacity-building, infrastructure development, and \ncontinuous monitoring and evaluation are vital for the suc\u00ad\ncessful implementation of the NSOAP and the improve\u00ad\nment of SOA services at the regional and district levels. \nSeveral areas requiring attention and improvement were \nidentified, including gaps in capacity for service provision, \nworkforce shortage, infrastructure and equipment, coordi\u00ad\nnation and governance, and capacity building. Despite \nsome positive aspects, such as an increase in the number \nof general healthcare facilities and a modest increase in \nthe density of SOA providers, there are several challenges \nhighlighted that need to be addressed to enhance the deliv\u00ad\nery of safe and effective SOA services in the country and to \nachieve NSOAP objectives. \nIn general, there is a paucity of literature specific to \nNSOAP implementation in Tanzania, highlighting the need \nfor more research and evaluation studies to generate addi\u00ad\ntional information. \nAn Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n19\nRECOMMENDATIONS \nBased on the discussion and findings, the following specific \nrecommendations are proposed in ensuring that the NSOAP \nwill be implemented effectively as intended: \nNSOAP Dissemination: There is a need to ensure that \nthe NSOAP is disseminated to all key stakeholders espe\u00ad\ncially those working at the implementation level i.e., the re\u00ad\ngional and district levels. \nMonitoring and Evaluation of the NSOAP Imple\u00ad\nmentation: There is an urgent need to fast-track the im\u00ad\nplementation of the NSOAP monitoring and evaluation im\u00ad\nplementation framework. This will allow better collection \nof SOA related indicators to be able to track performance \nof the services in general such as types of surgeries, anes\u00ad\nthesia details, patient outcomes and other gaps in SOA ser\u00ad\nvice provision. These indicators will be useful in tracking \nprogress of achievement of the NSOAP objectives. \nStrengthen capacity at the district level: Efforts \nshould be made to strengthen the capacity of SOA service \nprovision at the district level. This includes improving re\u00ad\nferral systems, expanding the availability of CEmONC ser\u00ad\nvices, addressing shortages in critical areas like anesthesia \nand critical care, and ensuring a robust supply chain for \nSOA-specific supplies and consumables. \nIncrease the number of skilled SOA professionals: To \nmeet the growing demand for SOA services, there is a need \nto increase the number of skilled healthcare professionals, \nparticularly anesthesiologists. Strategies should be imple\u00ad\nmented to improve the recruitment, training, and distribu\u00ad\ntion of healthcare professionals in the SOA field. Specific \nactions should be taken for critical areas such as anesthe\u00ad\nsia and critical care through sensitizing medical students to \naspire for these specializations and provision of motivation \npackages and sponsorship opportunities for those who wish \nto specialize in these cadres. \nEnhance coordination and governance: The coordina\u00ad\ntion and implementation of the NSOAP should be strength\u00ad\nened at both the national and regional levels. This includes \nincreasing awareness of the plan among key stakeholders, \nfostering greater participation and engagement in the plan\u00ad\nning process, improving communication and coordination \namong healthcare professionals and decision-makers, and \nappointing dedicated NSOAP coordinators at the regional \nlevel. \nPromote standardized training and guidelines: Ef\u00ad\nforts should be made to develop standardized training pro\u00ad\ngrams for health providers in the SOA field, including es\u00ad\ntablishment of surgical outreach and mentorship programs \nto lower-level facilities. SOPs and clinical guidelines for \nSOA should be developed and coordinated at the national \nlevel to ensure consistent quality of care. Training pro\u00ad\ngrams, mentorship and continuous monitoring should be \nencouraged to promote adherence to safety protocols, such \nas the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. \nSecure funding and evaluate progress: More aggres\u00ad\nsive efforts are needed to secure funding for the imple\u00ad\nmentation of the NSOAP. Regular evaluations should be \nconducted to assess the progress made, identify existing \nbarriers, and revise the plan to reflect the current reality \non the ground. There is a need to continue to advocate for \nNSOAP funding and identify donors who will be able to \nprovide funding for the activities outlined in the NSOAP. \nOtherwise, most activities in the plan will never be imple\u00ad\nmented to the same extent as stipulated in the plan. \nRevitalize the NSOAP Technical Working Group: \nThe NSOAP Technical Working Group at the national level \nplays a vital role in coordinating partners involved in SOA \nprojects. Efforts should be made to revitalize the group and \nensure its active participation in driving the implementation \nof the NSOAP. \nNSOAP Mid-term Evaluation: we recommend a more \nrobust evaluation of NSOAP implementation through a \nmid-term evaluation exercise using more interactive meth\u00ad\nods to assess ALL NSOAP strategic objectives and activ\u00ad\nities outlined in the plan, and hence show a more realistic \npicture of the state of implementation to date. \nKey Lessons learnt \nBaseline Assessment: A critical aspect often overlooked \nin policy implementation is the necessity of conducting a \ncomprehensive baseline assessment. This foundational step \nserves as a crucial benchmark, providing insights into the \nexisting state and capacity within the healthcare system. In \nour case, a baseline assessment would have helped to estab\u00ad\nlish the status quo and provide a more meaningful under\u00ad\nstanding of the availability of services, infrastructure, and \nhuman resources at the outset to be able to track progress \nover time. It is therefore critical to invest time and resources \nin thoroughly understanding the existing healthcare land\u00ad\nscape before embarking on an ambitious policy endeavour, \nsuch as the NSOAP. \nPolicy Dissemination: It is essential to ensure that the \npolicy is widely disseminated to all key stakeholders, espe\u00ad\ncially those that are involved in the day-to-day implemen\u00ad\ntation of activities related to the plan such as the RHMTs. \nIn our case, the limited participation of RHMT members \nin the NSOAP development process and their general lack \nof awareness about the plan, might have contributed to the \nslow implementation of the plan at the ground level. \nFunding: The successful implementation and sustained \nimpact of the NSOAP is heavily dependent on a robust \nand sustainable financing plan. Adequate funding is the \nlifeblood that ensures the realization of proposed interven\u00ad\ntions, the improvement of healthcare infrastructure, and the \nenhancement of SOA services. Creating a sustainable fi\u00ad\nnancing plan involves multi-stakeholder collaboration. The \nfinancing plan should be intricately linked to the policy ob\u00ad\njectives outlined in the NSOAP. Advocacy efforts at both \nAn Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n20\nnational and international levels are integral to securing \nsustained funding for the NSOAP. \nGovernance Structure: Without effective leadership at \nthe implementation level of the plan, success is unlikely to \nbe achieved. The absence of NSOAP coordinators at the re\u00ad\ngional level is a significant barrier to plan implementation. \nEstablishing a governance structure at the regional level \nand appointing dedicated coordinators will enhance the ef\u00ad\nfectiveness of the NSOAP. \nMonitoring and Evaluation Framework: Establishing \na monitoring and evaluation framework for the NSOAP is \nessential. This would enable tracking progress, attributing \nimprovements in SOA services to NSOAP implementation, \nand identifying areas that require adjustments. \nSubmitted: June 23, 2023 EAT, Accepted: June 26, 2024 \nEAT \nAn Assessment of Progress and Challenges in the Implementation of the National Surgical, Obstetric, and \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n21\nReferences \n1.

It is a \npotentially fatal infection. The risk factors include pre-existing thyroid disorders, immunosuppression, and neck procedures. \nStaphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. \nThe case report aims to demonstrate the rarity of a huge thyroid abscess caused by Serratia odorifera in a postpartum \nwoman. \nA 42-year-old female with no known comorbidity but a 2-year history of an un-investigated thyroid mass and 1 month \npostpartum presented with 3 weeks of a painful anterior neck mass. She had no clinical features of hyperthyroidism \nalthough the thyroid hormone levels were consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. The thyroid abscess was confirmed \nby ultrasound scan. It was managed with appropriate antibiotics, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, and surgical drainage \nwith a good outcome. \nWe present a rare case of thyroid abscess caused by Serratia odorifera in a postpartum woman with subclinical \nhyperthyroidism. For a huge thyroid abscess, we recommend incision and drainage, and a minimum of two weeks of \nappropriate antibiotics. \nBackground \nThyroid abscess is a rare condition, and acute suppurative \nthyroiditis (AST) accounts for <1% of thyroid diseases.1 \nAST progresses to thyroid abscess and is a potentially fatal \ninfection.2,3 The majority of AST occurs in the left thyroid \nlobe.3 The infection reaches the thyroid lobe via direct \ntrauma, invasion from neighboring structures, and \nhematogenous spread.3 The risk factors include infective \nendocarditis, pre-existing thyroid disorders, immunosup\u00ad\npression (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), and congenital \nabnormalities such as pyriform sinus fistula and persistent \nthyroglossal duct.1,4 Thyroid abscess has been reported af\u00ad\nter fine needle aspiration, trauma to the anterior neck, upper \nrespiratory tract infection, multinodular goiter, autoimmune \nthyroiditis, and thyroid cancer.2,4,5 The organisms causing \nthyroid infections are bacteria (most commonly Staphylo\u00ad\ncoccus aureus), Streptococcus species, Mycobacterium tu\u00ad\nberculosis, parasites, viruses, and fungi.1,5\u20118 \nThe patient presents with classic and non-classic fea\u00ad\ntures of thyroid abscess. Patients might present with fever, \nneck pain, swelling, pressure symptoms, and airway com\u00ad\npromise.1 Depending on the thyroid hormone level, the \npatient might present with clinical features of hyperthy\u00ad\nroidism, hypothyroidism, or euthyroidism.1 Mycobacterial \nthyroid abscesses have been linked with a hyperthyroid \nstate while hypothyroid in fungal thyroid infection.9 \nThe diagnosis of thyroid abscess is clinical and the in\u00ad\nvestigative modalities include laboratory examination, neck \nradiographs, ultrasound and/or computer tomography (CT) \nscans, and fine needle aspiration biopsy.10 The ultrasound \nscan is the imaging of choice for the diagnosis of thyroid \ndisease.1,3 The ultrasound scan shows fluid accumulation, \nthe affected thyroid lobe, whether the lesion is unilocular or \nmultilocular, and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes.3 \nDue to its rarity, management is guided by case reports \nand series.1 However, the management of choice for thy\u00ad\nroid abscesses remains antibiotics and surgical drainage.5 \nThe preferred antibiotics include amoxicillin-clavulanate, \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

She had no \nfevers or chills, difficulty in breathing, cough, palpitations, \nanxiety, heat intolerance, or weight loss. She denied any \nneck surgical procedure before the presentation and neither \ntook alcohol nor smoked. \nOn physical examination, she was noted to be afebrile \n(36.7), normotensive (128/72 mmHg), and oxygen satura\u00ad\ntion of 97%. On admission, the pulse was 122 beats per \nminute and reduced to normal ranges throughout her admis\u00ad\nsion. She had no clinical signs of hyperthyroidism. She had \na huge 12cm*14cm tender anterior neck swelling without \npalpable lymph nodes. The swelling was soft and fluctuant \nwith shiny overlying skin. The oropharynx and the rest of \nthe systemic examination were non-revealing. \nLaboratory tests revealed moderate microcytic anemia \n7.70g/dl, leukocytosis (WCC 11.13x10^9/L), neutrophilia \n80.6% with thrombocytosis of 836x10^9/L. Chemistry re\u00ad\nvealed sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 3.0 mmol/L, \nurea of 2.6 mmol/L, and creatinine of 68 \u00b5mol/L. The thy\u00ad\nroid function test revealed low thyroid-stimulating hormone \n(TSH) 0.04mIU/L with normal free thyroxine (T4) 15.18 \npmol/L and free tri-iodothyronine (T3) 4.32 pmol/L. \nUltrasound scan showed enlarged thyroid lobes with the \nright lobe having a central necrotic loculated lesion con\u00ad\ncerning an abscess and no cervical lymphadenopathy. The \npus was negative for Mycobacterial PCR GeneXpert and \nso was the urine Mycobacterial Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) \nantigen test. Pus studies revealed a gram-negative bacilli \nSerratia odorifera sensitive to amikacin, ceftriaxone, \ncephalothin, gentamicin, and ofloxacin. The chest radi\u00ad\nograph and computer tomography (CT) scan were not done \nas they were not accessible at the time. \nThe thyroid abscess was initially aspirated under ultra\u00ad\nsound guidance (100ml drained) and on day 3 the site of \nthe puncture burst and a formal incision and drainage were \nperformed under local anesthesia. About 80 ml of thick yel\u00ad\nlowish non-foul-smelling pus was drained (figure 1). The \npus progressively reduced in volume without reaccumulat\u00ad\ning. She was empirically placed on intravenous cloxacillin \nFigure 1. Post open surgical drainage of the thyroid \nabscess \n500mg four times a day for five days before being switched \nto intravenous ceftriaxone 1g twice daily based on the lab\u00ad\noratory antibiogram. For pain, she received paracetamol 1g \nthrice daily orally. She was discharged on day 6 on oral \nofloxacin 400mg twice daily for a week and Pregamal (Fer\u00ad\nrous Fumarate and Folic Acid) one tablet per day for thirty \ndays. The follow-up was uneventful. \nDiscussion \nThe final diagnosis was a thyroid abscess in a postpartum \nwoman. Thyroid abscess is rare due to its fibrous encap\u00ad\nsulation, iodine-rich environment, extensive lymphatic \ndrainage, and abundant dual blood supply.1,2 Infection of \nthe neck risks airway compromise and therefore requires \nprompt diagnosis and treatment.2 A thyroid abscess is a se\u00ad\nrious, life-threatening endocrine emergency.2 \nThyroid abscess is frequently reported in children and \nfemales aged 20 to 40 years.5,10 Thyroid abscesses are \ncommonly observed on the left side although it involved \nmore of the right thyroid lobe in our 42-year-old postpartum \nmother.8,11\u201113 Meanwhile, some studies show that ab\u00ad\nscesses occur equally in each thyroid lobe.2 A pre-existing \nthyroid disorder is a risk factor for thyroid abscess forma\u00ad\ntion and our patient had a longstanding thyroid swelling \nwhich was not investigated before admission for thyroid ab\u00ad\nscess.1,4,8 Clinically, our patient did not present with clas\u00ad\nsic features of hyperthyroidism such as heat intolerance, \npalpitations, tremors, anxiety, weight loss, and increased \nappetite.2 Although all her vitals were normal throughout \nthe hospital stay, she was tachycardic on admission. The \ntachycardia could have been attributed to pain or infection \nwhich resolved after treatment.14 In our case, the thyroid \nhormone levels were consistent with subclinical hyperthy\u00ad\nroidism. Euthyroid, as well as hypothyroidism, has been \nreported in thyroid abscesses.1,11 Other authors argue that \nrarely is hyperthyroidism associated with acute suppurative \nThyroid abscess in a postpartum woman with subclinical hyperthyroidism: A Case Report\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n6\nthyroiditis7 as the majority of patients (83.1%) with bac\u00ad\nterial infections of the thyroid were euthyroid.9 However, \nhyperthyroidism has been documented in thyroid abscesses \nin the background of a multinodular goiter.15 Furthermore, \ntransient thyrotoxicosis in thyroid abscesses has been attrib\u00ad\nuted to the release of thyroid hormones by the damaged thy\u00ad\nroid follicles.12 \nThe classic features of thyroid abscess are fever, cervical \npain, and a painful mass,13 and the majority of patients pre\u00ad\nsent with painful neck swelling.1,4,5 Patients could present \nwith difficulties in breathing, dysphonia, and odynopha\u00ad\ngia.2,9 In our case, she presented with both classic and non-\nclassic features of thyroid abscess. Some authors lament \nthat non-classic presentation led to a low index of clinical \nsuspicion.10 Furthermore, misinterpretation of the available \nimaging modalities results in delayed diagnosis of thyroid \nabscess and progressive respiratory insult.10 \nThyroid abscess was confirmed through clinical findings \nand ultrasound scan.13 The ultrasound scan speedily identi\u00ad\nfied the abscess, affected thyroid lobe, and size, and guided \nthe percutaneous aspiration.10 The ultrasound was cost-\neffective, highly accessible, and confirmed the diagnosis \nwithout exposing the patient to ionizing radiation.10 The \nCT scan was not readily accessible or reported at our facil\u00ad\nity. Arguably, the CT scan is the next modality of choice \nprovided the ultrasound scan is inconclusive.1 Although the \nCT scan of the neck was never performed in our case, it de\u00ad\nlineate the thyroid abscess, the extent of the infection, dis\u00ad\nplaced structures, and extra-thyroidal extension.7,15 \nThe traditional management of choice for an abscess \nis surgical drainage and antibiotics. Moreover, modalities \nsuch as ultrasound or CT-guided drainage or needle as\u00ad\npiration, transcervical incision and drainage, and transoral \ndrainage are utilized.1,5 Literature showed that needle aspi\u00ad\nration drainage is recommended for thyroid abscesses less \nthan three centimeters while catheter drainage for greater \nthan three centimeters.5 In unstable cases with airway com\u00ad\npromise, it is recommended to urgently drain the abscess.2 \nIn our case, transcervical incision and drainage were per\u00ad\nformed after an unsuccessful ultrasound-guided needle as\u00ad\npiration. Our case serves as an example of a failure or inad\u00ad\nequacy of ultrasound-guided needle aspiration in managing \na huge thyroid abscess. Therefore, we recommend incision \nand drainage for a huge thyroid abscess. \nAdditionally, thyroidectomy is reserved for failed open \ndrainage, and persistent or recurrent abscesses.2,12 To re\u00ad\nmove the local source of infection, thyroid lobectomy has \nbeen performed in patients with no clinical improvement \nafter non-operative treatment.2,3,15 Other surgical options \nemployed to relieve pressure symptoms caused by the thy\u00ad\nroid abscess include total thyroidectomy, near-total thy\u00ad\nroidectomy, and hemithyroidectomy.3 \nIn our case, the pus analysis showed a gram-negative \nbacillus S. odorifera. As such, this case study adds S. odor\u00ad\nifera to the list of possible causes of a huge thyroid abscess. \nMultiple causative pathogens have been documented, \nmostly S. aureus and Streptococcus species, but also Es\u00ad\ncherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, \nHemophilus influenza, Eikenella corrodens, M. tubercu\u00ad\nlosis, parasite, viruses, candida.1,2,5\u20117 Thyroid abscesses \ncaused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA), and gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter cal\u00ad\ncoaceticus and baumanii have been reported.1,5,7,9 How\u00ad\never, in some cases of thyroid abscesses, the causative or\u00ad\nganisms are not established.1,7 \nSeveral routes have been used to administer antibiotics \nin thyroid abscesses, mainly orally and intravenously, but \nalso injected in the abscess cavity after aspirating the pus.5 \nIn our case, intravenous cloxacillin was administered em\u00ad\npirically and switched to intravenous ceftriaxone based on \nsensitivity pattern with a good outcome. Ceftriaxone has \nalso been used in K. pneumoniae thyroid abscesses with a \ngood outcome.11 Other antibiotics documented in treating \nthyroid abscesses are amoxicillin-clavulanate, benzylpeni\u00ad\ncillin, clindamycin, azithromycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, \nvancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin.2,5,7 An average \nof 14 days of antibiotic therapy was found to be sufficient \nin treating thyroid abscesses.2,12 Furthermore, it is recom\u00ad\nmended to use antimicrobial therapy for a minimum of two \nweeks in treating thyroid abscess, and the choice of antibi\u00ad\notic is based on laboratory antibiogram.3 \nIn case of delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and/or \nuntreated condition, the disease causes significant morbid\u00ad\nity and mortality.3,10 The mortality rate ranges from 3.7 \nto 12.1%.2,4,9 Besides being a life-threatening endocrine \nemergency, it can complicate into failed drainage, abscess \nrupture, persistent abscesses, fistulae to the trachea or \nesophagus, descending necrotizing mediastinitis, sepsis, \nairway compromise, and recurrent acute suppurative thy\u00ad\nroiditis.1,2,5,12 \nConclusion \nThyroid abscess is an extremely rare condition. We present \na rare case of thyroid abscess in a postpartum woman with \nsubclinical hyperthyroidism and add Serratia odorifera to \nthe list of possible causes of thyroid abscess. The ultra\u00ad\nsound scan remains the preferred imaging of choice in the \ndiagnosis and needle-guided treatment of thyroid abscess. \nFor a huge thyroid abscess, we recommend incision and \ndrainage, and a minimum of two weeks of appropriate an\u00ad\ntibiotic therapy. The outcome is good with appropriate \nmanagement. \nSubmitted: December 20, 2022 EAT, Accepted: May 01, \n2024 EAT \nThyroid abscess in a postpartum woman with subclinical hyperthyroidism: A Case Report\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n7\nReferences \n1.

Worldwide revision rates vary between 4.9-7.9%. However, in the sub-Saharan African \nregion, revision total knee arthroplasty has rarely been studied. \nBroad Objective \nTo determine the rate and indications for RTKAs in primary TKA surgeries operated at MOI between 2007 and 2018. \nMethodology \nThis was a retrospective study. Revision TKA surgery data was collected from the TKA registry. Univariate analysis and \ndescriptive statistics were used for analysis and presentation of categorical and continuous data. Statistical significance was \ndetermined in all relevant associations. \nResults \nOut a total of 607 primary TKA procedures recorded, 40 required revision, with a mean age of 69.1 years, a female \npredominance (60%) and a left knee predominance (62.5%), giving a revision rate of 6.59%. The causes of revision TKA \nincluded aseptic loosening (47.5%) and periprosthetic infections (32.5%). Both femoral and tibial components were revised in \n50% of the surgeries. The mean duration from primary surgery until revision surgery was 4.1 years. Prosthesis infection was \nassociated with early revision surgery (p value 0.008) but most patients had late revision TKA surgery (p value 0.02). \nConclusion \nThe rate of revision TKA at MOI was similar to worldwide rates. Most revisions were done late (after 2 years), and the \npredominant cause of revision was aseptic loosening, but infection was positively associated with early revision. \nBACKGROUND \nTotal Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is the golden standard of \ncare for treatment of advanced degenerative and rheuma\u00ad\ntologic knee diseases and specific knee fractures. Arthro\u00ad\nplasty is the most successful and effective surgical option \nto reduce pain and restore function in patients with severe \nosteoarthritis.1,2 TKA is done commonly worldwide3\u20115 and \nis the most common major orthopaedic procedure in the \nUSA.6 \nTKA was first performed in the 1970s and it has been \nbeneficial to a majority of recipients as it is cost-effective \nand improves the quality of life of the patients.7 \nDespite the effectiveness of TKA, a significant number \nof patients face the prospect of revision surgery due to the \nlimited lifespan of the prosthesis and various other causes \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg.\n2024;29(2):29-34. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.6\nincluding prosthesis loosening, persistent pain, instability \nand infection.8 There has also been a steady rise in the \nneed for Revision TKA (RTKA) due to increasing life ex\u00ad\npectancy and expanding indications of primary TKA.9\u201112 \nThe cumulative survival rate of TKR was shown to be \nhigher than 90% in the first 8 years, decreasing to 83.5% \nat 10 years, then maintaining stable results after 10 years.13 \nBy the year 2030, TKA revisions in the United States will \ngrow by approximately 600%, compared to 2005, to an es\u00ad\ntimated 268,200 cases per year, with greater than 50% of \nthese revision procedures expected to occur in the younger \nage groups starting from 2011.6,8,14 \nStudies have categorized the failure causes after total \nknee arthroplasties into early (within the first 2 years after \nprimary TKA) and late revision. Due to bone loss and soft \ntissue insufficiency, the overall outcome of revision TKA is \nnot as good as the primary arthroplasty.15\u201117 The revision \noften needs stemmed components and additional augments, \nin order to address deficient bone stock and soft tissue in\u00ad\ntegrity.6 \nAlthough aseptic loosening may be the leading cause \nof revision surgery, advancements in implants and surgical \ntechniques has reduced this complication, and septic com\u00ad\nplications have instead relatively increased over time.7,18\u201120 \nThere are many indications for TKA in the sub-Saharan \nAfrica, but unfortunately most countries don\u2019t have ade\u00ad\nquate means to offer the service, including the necessary \nfacilities, resources, and healthcare professionals. Although \nrevision TKA is being done in Tanzania, not much is \nknown about its epidemiology to make any significant com\u00ad\nparative analysis to other countries. The main aim of the \nstudy was to explore the rate and indications of revision \nknee arthroplasties in primary knee arthroplasty surgeries \ndone at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute, located in Dar es \nSalaam, Tanzania. \nMETHODOLOGY \nStudy design and setting \nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted \nat Muhimbili Orthopaedic institute (MOI), the largest or\u00ad\nthopaedic and trauma referral institute in Tanzania, located \nin Dar es Salaam, with a 362-bed capacity, attending an av\u00ad\nerage of 4000 patients per week. \nStudy population, duration, inclusion and \nexclusion criteria \nThe study population included all patients 18 years and \nabove, who underwent primary bicompartmental total knee \narthroplasty (posterior stabilised design, cemented fixation) \nat MOI from 2007 to 2018 and subsequently had revision \nsurgery at MOI. Patients who had their primary or revision \nTKAs done at other centres, were excluded due to either in\u00ad\nsufficient data, challenges in contacting and tracing patients \nand to reduce extraneous variable effect related to differ\u00ad\nences in centre related treatment protocols and follow up. \nData collection and management \nData was collected, using a structured questionnaire, \nmainly from MOI\u2019s arthroplasty registry books. Data avail\u00ad\nable in the registry included patients\u2019 demographic charac\u00ad\nteristics (name, age and sex), indications for revision TKA \nsurgery (diagnosis), types of surgery done and the surgery \nteam members involved. Time lapse from primary to revi\u00ad\nsion TKA was calculated in years. \nPatients with prosthesis infection were confirmed by \npre-operative elevated serum infectious markers (C-Reac\u00ad\ntive Protein and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and with/\nwithout positive organism isolation and culture. \nCollected data was stored on a MS Excel (Microsoft \nCorp., Redmond, WA, USA) database and exported to IBM \nStatistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 (IBM \nCorp., Armonk, NY, USA) software for analysis. \nStatistical analysis \nUnivariate analysis was used for categorical variables. \nMean, median, interquartile range and standard deviation \nwere used for continuous variables. Chi-square test, Fisher \nT exact test and relative risk were used to determine associ\u00ad\nation significance between variables. \nA 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated to quan\u00ad\ntify the precision of estimates in the population. A 5% alpha \n(p-value) was used to determine statistical significance dur\u00ad\ning analysis and interpretation. \nEthical Consideration \nEthical clearance was obtained from MOI Ethics Board. \nConfidentiality of the data was observed throughout the \nstudy. The database access was limited only to the investi\u00ad\ngators. \nRESULTS \n1. Socio-Demographic Characteristics of \nthe Patients \nTable 1 summarises the patients\u2019 characteristics stratified \nby sex. A total of 607 primary TKAs (bicompartmental, \nposterior stabilised design, cemented fixation) were done \nbetween 2007 and 2018, and 40 cases were revised, giving \na revision rate of 6.59% (95 % CI 4.75-8.87%). \nFemale predominance (60%) was seen in revision TKA \nsurgery (24 patients). The age range was 41 years, with a \nminimum age of 46 years. The mean and median ages were \n69.1 years and 71.5 years respectively, with some differ\u00ad\nences noted between the two genders (mean age difference \np-value 0.91, median age difference p-value 0.97). \nRevision Knee Arthroplasties Done at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute, Tanzania, between 2007 and 2018\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n30\nTable 1.

Indications of Revision TKA Surgery and \nTime Lapse from Primary TKA Surgery to \nRevision TKA surgery \nMajority of the revisions (25 patients or 62.5%) were done \non the left knee (95% CI 45.8%-84.0%), compared to the \nright knee (p-value 0.08). Time period from primary TKA \nto revision TKA varied from 2 months to 12 years, with a \nmean period of 4.1 years (SD 2.9 years). More patients had \nlate revisions (i.e. 2 years and above from primary TKA \nsurgery) compared to early revisions; 28 patients (70%) \nwith late revisions (95% CI 53-87%) vs. 12 patients (30%) \nwith early revisions, (95% CI 4.1-55.9%) p-value 0.02. \n3. Causes of Revision TKA surgery in the \npatients \nThe predominant cause of revision TKA was aseptic loos\u00ad\nening of the prosthesis (19 patients, 47.5%), followed by in\u00ad\nfection (13 patients 32.5%) and prosthetic instability (7 pa\u00ad\ntients, 17.5%) due to unbalanced ligaments, malposition of \ncomponents and/or improper alignment. Prosthesis infec\u00ad\ntion was revised at an average of 1.3 years (SD 1.2) from \nthe primary TKA and was positively associated with early \nrevision surgery (RR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.3, p value 0.008). \nAseptic loosening was revised at an average of 4.7 years \n(SD 2.5) from the primary TKA and was positively associ\u00ad\nated with late revision surgery (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5, p \nvalue 0.018). \n4. Types of Revision TKA surgeries in the \npatients \nFrom the 40 revisions done, 20 (50%) of them involved \nonly revising both tibia and femoral knee components in the \nsame sitting, while 13 revisions (32.5%) involved a combi\u00ad\nnation of staged surgical debridement, joint washouts, pros\u00ad\nthesis removal, use of antibiotics spacers and future pros\u00ad\nthesis fixation once infection was deemed clear (normal \nserum ESR and CRP for 3 months). Isolated same sitting \nRevision Knee Arthroplasties Done at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute, Tanzania, between 2007 and 2018\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n31\ntibia component revision (5 patients, 12.5%) or femoral \ncomponent revision (2 patients, 5%) was also observed. \nMale patients had a higher risk of early revision (RR 1.5, \n95% CI 0.6-3.8, p value 0.49) and a higher risk of infec\u00ad\ntion (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5-3.1, p value 0.58) while female \npatients had a higher risk of late revision (RR 1.2, 95% CI \n0.8-1.9, p value 0.31) and aseptic loosening (RR 1.3, 95% \nCI 0.6-2.8, p value 0.40). \nDISCUSSION \nThere are worldwide variations in TKA revision rates, due \nto disparities in access to quality healthcare resources and \npersonnel. The study focussed on patients who had both \ntheir primary and revision knee arthroplasty surgeries done \nat MOI. These patients were managed at the same institute \nand hence exposed to similar treatment protocols, reducing \nextraneous variables. The incidence rate of 6.59% in this \nstudy was similar to Pabinger et al\u2019s systemic review which \nreported an overall 10 year worldwide revision rate of 6.2% \nranging from 4.9% to 7.8%.21 While MOI\u2019s revision rate \nis within acceptable limits, others have reported both lower \nrates of up to 2.2%22 and even higher rates of 33.2%(34). \nMajority of the patients were females with a mean age of \n69.1 years, similar to other previous studies.18,23 This dif\u00ad\nference in gender representation was not statistically signif\u00ad\nicant. \nIt is documented worldwide that most TKA revisions are \ndue to aseptic loosening, infection and polyethene wear.3,\n18,24,25 The causes of revision in this study were similar to \nmultiple other previous studies. Aseptic loosening was the \npredominant cause of TKA revision in a study that analysed \ndata from 844 patients between 2010 and 2011 attended \nfrom 6 hospitals in the USA.26 Lombardi et al. reported \nnearly 31.2% of patients who needed TKA revisions were \ndue to aseptic loosening, while Peter et al., reported 39.9% \nof all TKA revisions were due to aseptic loosening.3 \nDelanois et al analysed TKA revision between 2009 and \n2013 from the USA, and reported infection as the aetiology \nof TKA revision among 20.4% of patient,27 while Anne et \nal, found infection as the cause of revision among 36.1% of \nall revisions7 and Peter et al found infection among 27.4% \nas a cause for revision.3 Owing to differences in patient \nbackgrounds and lifestyles, the causes of TKA failures in \nsub-Saharan Africa especially Tanzania may differ com\u00ad\npared to other parts of the world. \nMajority of the revisions (62.5%) were done on the left \nknee, but no statistical significance was found between the \nleft and right knee (p value 0.08). The mean time period \nfrom primary TKA to revision TKA was 4.1 years (SD 2.9) \nand study did significantly show 70% of the patients had \nlate revisions (i.e., 2 years and above) compared to early \nrevision surgery (p value 0.02). The findings are similar to \nother studies previously done. Postler et al reported a pri\u00ad\nmary TKA to revision surgery mean time of 6.2 years in \n289 TKA surgeries performed,18 while another study done \nin the USA highlighted a time lapse from primary TKA \nto revision TKA was 5.9 years and that 35.3% of all revi\u00ad\nsions occurred early (28). Another study reported from the \nUSA had comparable proportions of time until TKA revi\u00ad\nsions where early revisions comprised of 37.6% and late re\u00ad\nvisions 62.4% among 781 revisions done in 10 years.3 \nAn infected prosthesis was 4.2 times more likely to un\u00ad\ndergo early revision (p value 0.008) while a loose implant \nwas 1.6 times more likely to undergo late revision (p value \n0.018). Joint infection is likely to become evident much ear\u00ad\nlier than aseptic loosening, hence more likely to undergo re\u00ad\nvision surgery. No statistically significant associations were \nfound between the two genders, causes of revision and early \nvs. late revision surgery. \nCONCLUSION \nThe rate of revision TKA at MOI (6.59%) was similar to \nworldwide rates, with a mean age of 69.1 years, and a fe\u00ad\nmale predominance of 60%. Most revisions (70%) were \ndone late (after 2 years), and the predominant cause of re\u00ad\nvision was aseptic loosening (47.5%) which was positively \nassociated with late revision while prosthetic infection was \nlikely to lead to early revision TKA. Both femoral and tibia \ncomponents were revised in 50% of the revision TKA surg\u00ad\neries. A national arthroplasty surgery protocol and patient \nregistry is recommended for future research on arthroplasty \nin Tanzania. \nSTUDY LIMITATIONS \nThe study focussed only patients who had both their pri\u00ad\nmary and revision knee arthroplasty surgeries done at MOI. \nData was mainly collected from the arthroplasty registry, as \nit was difficult to contact and trace individual patients (not \navailable via telephone) hence the results may not be com\u00ad\npletely representative of the actual picture of revision TKA \nsurgeries at MOI. \nSubmitted: October 18, 2022 EAT, Accepted: January 05, \n2024 EAT \nRevision Knee Arthroplasties Done at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute, Tanzania, between 2007 and 2018\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n32\nReferences \n1.

Trauma, infections, and non-communicable diseases are among \nindications of amputations, but changing trends have been highlighted in various regions. We aimed to describe the \nexperience of limb amputations at our hospital to highlight patient characteristics, risk factors for mortality, and functional \noutcomes. \nMethods \nThe study was a descriptive, retrospective case series of all patients who underwent limb amputation from January 1st \n2018 to December 31st 2019. Patient data, including demographics, details of presentation, laboratory values, comorbidities, \noperations, and outcomes, were extracted from the electronic medical record. The primary outcomes were postoperative \nfunction and mortality. Comparison by risk factors for mortality was performed. \nResults \n154 patients underwent amputation. 121 (78.5%) were lower limb amputations. The average age was 52.2 years. Average \nduration of illness was 120 days. 93 (60.4%) patients were men. 82 (53.9%) had at least one comorbidity. Trauma was an \nindication for 57 (37%) patients and 74 (48%) had arterial disease. Diabetes was the most common comorbidity (N=62; 40%). \nThe in-hospital mortality rate was 10.4% (N=16). Patients with a presenting diagnosis of diabetes had increased mortality \nwhen compared to those without diabetes (19.2% vs. 5.9%; p=0.01). For the functional outcome, 59 (47.2%) were ambulant \non crutches and 27 (21.6%) were using a wheelchair. \nConclusions \nTrauma and vascular disease frequently contributes to the need for amputation in our region. Diabetes was present in one \nthird of the patients, and was a significant risk factor for mortality. Recognition of the impact of medical comorbidities is \nwarranted given these findings. \nIntroduction \nAn amputation is the surgical removal of a part of a body, \nsuch as an arm or a leg, and has been performed for cen\u00ad\nturies.1 Indications for amputation can include trauma, ma\u00ad\nlignancy, severe infections, and complications from various \nchronic diseases, including diabetes and peripheral arterial \ndisease.2,3 \nIn countries with lower development indices, the burden \nof trauma is devastating and increasing.4 In the past, most \namputations were carried out because of trauma.5 There \nhas been a shift towards lifestyle-caused diseases and other \nchronic illnesses that put patients at risk of amputation.6\u20119 \nThere is a need to understand better the impact of trauma \nand non-communicable diseases on the need for amputation \nin our setting, to examine the risk factors for mortality, and \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

We \naimed to describe the experience with extremity amputation \nat our institution to highlight various patient characteristics \nsuch as the prevalence of trauma and non-communicable \ndiseases, the risk factors for inpatient mortality, and their \nfunctional outcomes. \nStudy area \nTenwek Hospital, a faith-based tertiary referral centre in \nBomet County, Kenya, provides emergency management, \nincluding potential emergency amputations, upon patient \nadmission. Post-amputation, patients are placed in the crit\u00ad\nical care unit, general surgical ward, or orthopaedic ward \nbased on their cardiopulmonary status. During their stay, \nthey receive standard treatments such as antibiotics, anal\u00ad\ngesics, and anticoagulation.

We \nextracted data through a chart review of patients identified \nto have undergone an amputation in the electronic medical \nrecord. We stored data in Microsoft Excel and performed \nthe analysis in Stata (Version 16). \nDuring chart review of the electronic medical record, the \nfollowing parameters were collected: age, sex, duration of \npresenting complaint, presence and duration of known rele\u00ad\nvant comorbidities, tobacco smoking status, initial random \nblood sugars, initial white blood cell count initial Erythro\u00ad\ncyte Sedimentation Rate, Human Immunodeficiency Virus \nstatus, Hemoglobin A1c level, any diagnosis of comorbid\u00ad\nity while admitted, an attempt at limb salvage, amputation \nindication, after stump formalization, mortality, discharge \ndiagnosis, and the patient\u2019s progress in terms of functional \nstatus. The primary outcomes were postoperative function \nand mortality. Risk factors for mortality were assessed, and \ndescriptive statistics were utilized. Comparisons were per\u00ad\nformed on potential risk factors for the outcome of mor\u00ad\ntality by chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a \nStudent\u2019s t-test for continuous variables. \nTable 1.

There were a large number of \nguillotine amputations required (66 patients; 43%), which \nis a marker for the severity of the illness.9 Typically, these \namputations are necessary when a limb is infected, and the \npatient is too sick to tolerate formalization during the initial \noperation. The rate of mortality for our series was consis\u00ad\ntent with other reports in Africa.3,8\u201111 From the region, half \nof the patients may experience complications after amputa\u00ad\ntion as reported in a case series from Tanzania.10 As often \nthe last option available for patients, these findings indicate \nthe severity and complexity of amputations at our hospital. \nThere is an emerging shift from communicable to non-\ncommunicable diseases in developing countries.6 This \nstudy recorded the number of amputations caused by arter\u00ad\nial disease at 48%, which aligns with similar estimates that \npoint to a growing percentage of non-communicable dis\u00ad\neases in the region.8 Forester et al. found that at a referral \nhealth facility in Cameroon, the most common reason pa\u00ad\ntients had amputations were infections and vascular disease \nfrom poorly treated diabetes and peripheral vascular dis\u00ad\nease.12 Diabetes was present in one-third of patients, and a \nsignificant risk factor for mortality. Systematic reviews and \nmeta-analyses have demonstrated the high incidence of di\u00ad\nabetes-related amputations to demonstrate the large burden \nof diabetes.13,14 At another facility in Kenya, Ogeng\u2019o et \nal. found that diabetic vascular disease was the most com\u00ad\nmon reason for amputation between October 1998 and De\u00ad\ncember 2008.15 This appears to be a growing problem with \nhigh inpatient mortality.10 \nInterestingly, the study from Ogeng\u2019o was before the \nwidespread subsidization and increase of motorcycles.16 \nThus, motor vehicle collisions have likely increased and \ntrauma as an indication for amputation may increase as \nwell. Trauma is increasing in Africa and in Kenya.16 A his\u00ad\ntory of trauma was responsible for 37% of amputations in \nour population. Efforts to prevent trauma are necessary.17 \nSeveral patients were diagnosed with a new medical co\u00ad\nmorbidity during their admission for amputation. Diabetes \nwas the most common newly diagnosed comorbidity (40%) \nand the prevalence of this is a potential future study topic. \nPractitioners should be aware of the higher risk of mortality \namong patients with diabetes who undergo amputation. The \npopulation\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding \nhealth seeking behavior can also be deduced from patients \nnoted to have a new comorbidity diagnosis at admission.18 \nDelays on presentation to the hospital were considerable \nwith an average of 120 days for the duration of illness. In\u00ad\nvestigation into referral patterns and health-seeking behav\u00ad\nior appears necessary. Efforts to detect problems and avoid \namputations, which have been effective in other settings, \nseem appropriate in our population.7 \nAltered function is assessed from a patient\u2019s rehabilita\u00ad\ntion using a prosthesis, crutches, or a wheelchair. The eco\u00ad\nnomic status of the study population is informative in this \nregard, as funds are an important factor that influences a pa\u00ad\ntient\u2019s decision on postoperative rehabilitation.10,19 Almost \nall patients did not have access to a prosthetic after ampu\u00ad\ntation. This limited uptake is an avenue for future interven\u00ad\ntion. \nThere were several limitations to this study. The retro\u00ad\nspective nature of the chart review limited the outcomes \navailable. The ability to determine the underlying cause of \namputation and the impact of diabetes on arterial disease \nor infection was challenging.

We aimed to describe the indications, \nmanagement, and outcomes of patients managed with TT at AIC Litein Hospital in Southwestern Kenya. \nMethods \nThis prospective study was undertaken between November 2020 and August 2022. All consecutive patients with TT were \nincluded. Data were collected on demographics, presentation, indications for TT, management, and outcome. Ethical approval \nwas obtained from the Institutional Ethics and Research Committee. \nResults \nThe study included 39 (33 male, 6 female) patients who had a mean age of 35 years (range 3-75) and 45 TTs placed for a \nmedian duration of 6 days (1-26). Hemopneumothorax (n=19), empyema thoracis (n=8), and pneumothorax (n=7) were the \nmost common indications for TT. Trauma was noted in 28 cases presenting as assault (n=17), road traffic collision (n=8), fall \n(n=1), and barotrauma (n=1). Preadmission traumatic injuries led to four deaths, while fourteen (35.9%) patients developed \nTT-related complications, with three requiring TT replacement. \nConclusions \nIn this series, TT was mainly indicated for hemopneumothorax, empyema thoracis, and pneumothorax. \nIntroduction \nTube thoracostomy (TT) involves the placement of a \ndrainage tube within the pleural cavity to remove accumu\u00ad\nlated air, fluid, blood, or pus.1\u20113 They are commonly in\u00ad\nserted in the \u201cTriangle of Safety\u201d at the fourth or fifth inter\u00ad\ncostal space in the anterior or mid-axillary line.1,3,4 While \nthe indications for TT might be similar for various health \nfacilities, the distribution pattern of these indications may \ndiffer depending on the facility\u2019s size and catchment area, \nlocal trauma patterns, and management protocols.2,5 \nThere is a paucity of published literature from Africa re\u00ad\ngarding the use of TT, especially in smaller health facili\u00ad\nties.2,5\u20118 The purpose of this study was to fill this identified \ngap in knowledge by reviewing our institution\u2019s experience \nwith TT. Specifically, this prospective observational study \naimed to describe the distribution of indications and pattern \nof complications of patients managed with TT at a single \n220-bed capacity faith-based institution in Kericho County, \nSouthwestern Kenya. \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

Indications and Outcome of Patients\nManaged with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospective Case Series.\nEast Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(2):9-14. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i2.3\nMethods \nThis prospective case series was undertaken at AIC Litein \nHospital from 1st November 2020 to 31st August 2022. \nCases were defined as any consecutive patient managed \nwith TT and consented to be included in the study. Those \nwho declined to have TT, were referred, or died before TT \nwere excluded. Informed consent was obtained by one or \nmore of the general surgery residents prior to or after TT \ndepending on the urgency of the procedure and the patient\u2019s \noverall condition. Patients were managed by general sur\u00ad\ngeons with experience, but not specialization in thoracic \nsurgery, and complex thoracic cases are typically referred \nto a nearby tertiary referral center. This observational study \ndid not influence the management of the patients; thus, no \npatient received any additional care or benefit for accepting \nto be included, nor did any have withheld or lower quality \ncare for refusing to participate in the study. \nPatients were managed based on their overall diagnosis, \nthe attending surgeon\u2019s discretion, and a standardized tube \nthoracostomy protocol (appendix 1). Due to varied levels \nof clinicians in training (medical officer interns, junior and \nsenior residents), TTs were preferentially placed within the \ntriangle of safety at the fourth or fifth intercostal space uti\u00ad\nlizing the blunt dissection technique and supervised or per\u00ad\nformed by the attending surgeon. Chest tubes were con\u00ad\nnected to a three-compartment integrated disposable chest \ndrainage unit. Due to resource limitations, these disposable \nunits were reused after disinfection and disposed of when \nthey were noted to malfunction or be broken. Suction was \nused only in patients with significant air leaks or poor lung \nexpansion on chest radiography. \nData from the patients were collected using a prestruc\u00ad\ntured questionnaire that included patients\u2019 demographics, \nclinical presentation, indications for TT, management, and \noutcome at discharge and at least four weeks post-TT. The \noutcome was defined as the resolution of the indication for \nTT, the presence or absence of complications related to \nTT placement, or inpatient mortality. Complications were \ncategorized into five separate categories (insertional, posi\u00ad\ntional, infective/immunologic, removal, and equipment-re\u00ad\nlated) based on a validated classification methodology by \nAho et al.9 Follow-up was done through perusal of the pa\u00ad\ntient\u2019s electronic medical records taken during clinic atten\u00ad\ndance and telephone review for those noted not to have at\u00ad\ntended clinic or whose last attendance date was less than \nfour weeks post-TT. \nData were abstracted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, \nand results were summarized using descriptive statistics. \nWe compared the duration of TT for patients with traumatic \nand non-traumatic indications using Students t-test. We \ncompared the percentage of complications for each TT \nplaced by residents and consultants using Chi-square analy\u00ad\nsis. Ethical approval was obtained before the initiation of \nthe study by the Institutional Ethics and Research Commit\u00ad\ntee (IREC) (IREC/2020/4). This case series has been re\u00ad\nported per the PROCESS guidelines.10 \nResults \nDemographics \nDuring the study period, 43 patients were noted to require \nTT; however, two declined to consent to be included in the \nstudy, one patient with empyema thoracis was referred prior \nto TT, and one patient with a large malignant pleural ef\u00ad\nfusion died prior to TT placement. Thus 39 patients were \nanalyzed, who comprised 33 males and 6 females with a \nmedian age of 35 years (range 3-75). It was noted that 16 \n(41.02%) had health insurance coverage. Eight (20.51%) \ncases were referred from a peripheral facility. \nThe most common symptoms noted before TT place\u00ad\nment were chest pains, difficulty in breathing, and cough \nthat were present for a median period of 6 hours (range, 1 \nhour to 60 days) and a mean duration of 4 days (95% CI \n0.6-7.7). Trauma was noted in 28 patients secondary to as\u00ad\nsault (n=16 penetrating, n=1 blunt), road traffic collision \n(n=8), fall from a height (n=1), and ventilator-associated \nbarotrauma (n=1). In addition, these patients had other as\u00ad\nsociated injuries, most commonly to the ribs, diaphragm, or \nspleen (table 1). \nManagement \nA total of 45 TTs were placed for a median duration of \n6 days (range 1-26) and a mean duration of 7.62 +/- 6.43 \ndays. The majority (n=41, 91%) of TT were inserted in the\u00ad\natre. Three were placed in the general surgical ward and one \nin the high dependency unit (HDU) for a patient with ia\u00ad\ntrogenic pneumothorax (barotrauma) on mechanical venti\u00ad\nlation. Suction was selectively used in patients (empyema \nthoracis n=3, traumatic pneumothorax n=2) with significant \nair leak and poor lung expansion on chest radiography. Ul\u00ad\ntrasonography was not available during the study period. In \npatients with a history of trauma (n=28), TTs were placed \nfor hemopneumothorax (n=19, 48.7%), pneumothorax \n(n=6, 15.4%), and hemothorax (n=3, 7.7%). In those who \ndid not have trauma (n=11), TTs were placed for empyema \nthoracis (n=8, 20.5%), large pleural effusion (n=2, 5.1%), \nand pneumothorax (n=1, 2.5%). Most TTs were placed by \nthe attending surgeon (n=34), while residents placed 11 TTs \nunder supervision. The initial TT was unilateral in 36 pa\u00ad\ntients and bilateral in three patients. In addition, three TTs \nrequired replacement due to blockage (n=2, all placed by \nthe attending surgeon) or subcutaneous placement (n=1, \nplaced by the resident). Three patients with empyema tho\u00ad\nracis were noted to have persistent air leak with poor lung \nexpansion that did not improve on suction. These patients \nwere subsequently referred to a tertiary facility for tho\u00ad\nracotomy (table 2). A malfunction of the integrated chest \ndrainage unit was noted in four patients, and there was \nIndications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospecti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n10\nTable 1.

The sys\u00ad\ntem malfunction were noted within 12 to 24 hours of place\u00ad\nment of the TT. The malfunction involved a leak in the wa\u00ad\nter seal chamber in two patients, cracked connector in one \npatient, and one drainage system had two collection cham\u00ad\nbers that appeared separate, but one had to be sealed for \nproper function (as both were connected to the water seal \nand suction components). All these were noted early and \ncorrected with no long-term or severe adverse effects to the \npatients. \nOutcome \nPatients were admitted for a median duration of 7 days \n(range, 1-32) and a mean duration of 8.69 +/- 5.65 days, \nwith the end of hospitalization stratified as discharge (n=28, \n71.8%), referral (n=7, 17.9%), or mortality (n=4, 10.2%). \nReferrals were for thoracotomy patients with a persistent \nair leak and poor lung expansion post-TT for empyema \nthoracis (n=3), isolation in a patient with COVID-19 post-\nTT (n=1), dialysis for worsening renal failure in a patient \nwith blunt thoracoabdominal trauma (n=1), vascular injury \nin a patient with concomitant knee dislocation (n=1) and \nfor bronchoscopy in a patient with tracheobronchial injury \n(n=1). Mortalities occurred within 1-3 days post-surgery in \npatients with blunt (n=2) or penetrating (n=2) thoracoab\u00ad\ndominal trauma that led to irreversible hemorrhagic shock \n(n=2) or multisystem organ failure (n=2). Excluding pa\u00ad\ntients who died, the duration of TT was shorter for patients \nwho had trauma compared to those who did not (mean \n5.71+/- 3.13 days, n=24 versus mean 13.82 +/-8.39 days, \nn=11, p 0.0002). Four patients scheduled for follow-up at \nthe surgical clinic (n=28) did not show up, while five at\u00ad\ntended clinics less than four weeks post-TT. Four of these \nnine patients were successfully reached via phone and were \ndoing well. The median number of clinic visits was 2 (range \n1-6), while the median duration of follow-up post-TT was \nfour weeks (range 2-23). Surgical site infection was noted \nin two patients during their clinic reviews within four weeks \nof discharge (Table 2). Overall, 14 morbidities were ob\u00ad\nserved, with six occurring in 11 TTs placed by residents \nIndications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospecti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n11\nand eight occurring in 34 TTs placed by the general surgery \nconsultants (p=0.053). \nDiscussion \nThis study aimed to describe the distribution of indications \nand pattern of complications of patients managed with TT \nat a single health facility in Kenya. The findings suggest \nthat TT is predominantly used for trauma-related indica\u00ad\ntions, and the most common complication is equipment \nmalfunction. We included 39 patients with a median age \nof 35 years, who had 45 TTs placed for a median duration \nof 6 days. A history of trauma was noted in most cases \n(n=28, 71.8%), with the predominant type being penetrat\u00ad\ning trauma from assault (n=16, 41%). The most common \nindications for TT were hemopneumothorax (48.7% of all \ncases and 67.8% of those with trauma), empyema thoracis \n(20.5% of all cases and 72.7% of those without trauma), \nand pneumothorax (17.9% of all cases and 21.4% of pa\u00ad\ntients with a history of trauma). Four patients died due \nto pre-tube thoracostomy injuries, 14 (35.9%) morbidities \nwere noted up to one-month post-discharge, while 5 \n(14.2%) patients were lost to follow-up. \nSignificant variation was noted regarding the indications \nfor TT from various studies within Africa. In a Nigerian \nstudy reviewing the use of TT in trauma patients at three \nmajor teaching hospitals, Makama et al. noted that the most \ncommon indications for TT were hemopneumothorax \n(43%), pneumothorax (30%), and hemothorax (27%). Sev\u00ad\nenty-five percent of the cases had blunt trauma.6 Likewise, \nin a study conducted at a high-volume trauma center in \nSouth Africa, Kong et al. noted that 75% of cases had pen\u00ad\netrating trauma, and the TT indications were pneumothorax \n(38%), hemopneumothorax (30%) and hemothorax (30%).7 \nOn the other hand, Edaigbini et al., in their review con\u00ad\nducted at a facility in Nigeria that involved 26% of patients \nwith trauma, noted malignant pleural effusion (27.5%), \nparapneumonic effusion (12%) and empyema thoracis (7%) \nas the most common indications for TT.2 Mefire et al., in \ntheir study from a regional facility in Cameroon, noted that \n91% of the cases where TT was inserted had no history \nof trauma and non-purulent pleural effusion (69%) and \nempyema thoracis (12.69%) as the most common indica\u00ad\ntions for TT.5 Makanga et al., in their review from Kenya, \nnoted pleural effusion (70%), pneumothorax (14%), and \nempyema thoracis (5%) as the most common TT indication. \nPatients with trauma comprised only 15% of cases.8 The \nfindings in this study of the predominance of hemothorax, \npneumothorax, or hemopneumothorax in patients with \ntrauma, empyema thoracis, and pleural effusion in patients \nwithout a history of trauma as indications for TT is in keep\u00ad\ning with prior studies, but highlights the importance of un\u00ad\nderstanding local and regional indications for TT. \nThe reported mean duration of TT from various African \nstudies is 5-13 days.2,4\u20116,8 Nwofor et al. correctly pointed \nto the difference in the resolution time of various pleural \npathologies that impact the duration of TT.4 Thus, the dura\u00ad\ntion of TT for post-traumatic pneumothorax or hemothorax \nis expected to be shorter than for empyema thoracis. Indeed, \npatients with post-traumatic indications for TT in this study \nhad a shorter mean duration of TT compared to those who \nhad a non-traumatic indication (5.71 days vs. 13.82 days, \np=0.0002) \nThis study utilized the classification methodology devel\u00ad\noped by Aho et al.9 This enabled us to have a uniform com\u00ad\nplication reporting system and evaluate the impact of equip\u00ad\nment malfunction as the surgical department reused the \nsingle-use disposable commercial chest drainage unit to re\u00ad\nduce the overall cost to the patients. We have implemented \na standardized check of the system with uniform testing \nprior to each use to limit equipment malfunction. It was \nnoted that equipment malfunction contributed to 28% of \nthe overall complication, but this may have been underre\u00ad\nported. Residents were noted to have a higher rate of com\u00ad\nplications than the attending surgeons (54.5% vs. 23.5%), \nwith subcutaneous placement and improper equipment set-\nup being the most preventable complications. As a teaching \nhospital, it is important that trainees receive proper super\u00ad\nvision and autonomy to achieve adequate case volumes to \nbecome competent surgeons.11,12 Improved complication \nrecognition during critical time points and improved educa\u00ad\ntion on the performance of TT as well as proper equipment \nset-up will be beneficial.13 We recommend future empha\u00ad\nsis on training residents to ensure they are trained and cer\u00ad\ntified as competent in the set-up of the equipment in a dry \nlab simulation before using the equipment The overall com\u00ad\nplication rate in this study (35.9%) is much higher than re\u00ad\nported by Edaigbini et al., at 17%, and by Mefire et al., at \n19% but lower than reported by Nwofor et al., at 45%.2,4,5 \nThe higher rate may be attributed to the addition of equip\u00ad\nment malfunction and set up to complications that were not \npresent in the other reviews. \nThis series had a mortality rate of 14.2% in patients \nwith thoracic trauma (n=28) and was attributed to trauma-\nrelated injuries and not TT itself. Similarly, Dayananda et \nal. note that thoracic trauma can lead to an overall mortality \nrate of up to 20% and higher with penetrating thoracic stab \nwounds.14 \nLimitations \nOur findings are limited by the relatively small sample size, \na potential selection bias that may not represent the broader \npopulation of the region, and challenges in patient follow-\nup. In addition, the equipment malfunction may have been \nunderreported. A multi-institutional study involving vari\u00ad\nous hospitals from different regions in Kenya may better re\u00ad\nflect the indications and outcomes. \nIndications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospecti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n12\nConclusions \nIn this series, most patients had blunt or penetrating chest \ntrauma, with hemopneumothorax being the most common \nindication for TT. Reuse of chest drainage systems con\u00ad\ntributed significantly to equipment failure, but the potential \nconsequences on patient outcomes should be further ex\u00ad\nplored and compared to the costs of not reusing drainage \nsystems. \nSubmitted: May 07, 2023 EAT, Accepted: July 08, 2024 \nEAT \nIndications and Outcome of Patients Managed with Tube Thoracostomy at AIC Litein Hospital: A Prospecti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n13\nReferences \n1.

This regional survey study aims to identify perceived \nbarriers to policy formulation and, where applicable, implementation. \nMethods \nA combination of convenience, purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to distribute an electronic survey \nto SADC surgical care stakeholders. Adaptive questioning was utilised to evaluate perceived potential barriers by each \nrespondent, including government support for national surgical policy, the existence of a taskforce, resourcing for policy \ndevelopment, and specific challenges mapped to domains of the National Surgical, Obstetric and Anaesthesia Plan (NSOAP) \nManual. \nResults \nOf 182 participants that consented to participation, 60% (n=109) responded in full and 22% (n=40) logged a partial response \nthat was included in the analysis. 14/16 SADC countries were represented. 60% of respondents identified as healthcare \nprofessionals, 23% were academics and 24% represented government; there was poor representation from NGOs, civil \nsociety and potential donors. Twenty-seven percent (n=32) of respondents indicated that their country\u2019s government \nsupports and is driving the NSOAP development process. Financing (n=41, 82%) and stakeholder engagement (n=40, 80%) \nwere the domains most commonly cited as barriers to developing a national surgical health plan. Respondents from three \ncountries that had published NSOAPs cited inadequate integration into existing health plans and insufficient funding as \ncommon barriers to implementation. \nConclusions \nThere is a generalised perception of limited political conviction to drive national surgical improvement across the region, \nas well as funding and stakeholder engagement being significant barriers. For safe, timely, and affordable surgical care to \nbecome a reality, SADC governments need to exhibit strong leadership and engage potential funders (national treasury, \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

However, other Southern \nAfrican Development Community (SADC) Member States \nlag behind in policy development.3,4 \nNational Surgical, Obstetrics and Anaesthesia Plans \n(NSOAPs) were proposed by the Lancet Commission on \nGlobal Surgery as a policy framework that Ministries of \nHealth could use to evaluate and strengthen their health sys\u00ad\ntems\u2019 capacity to deliver surgical, obstetric and anaesthetic \n(SOA) care.5 These plans align with Member State political \ncommitments contained in World Health Assembly (WHA) \nresolution 68.15, which affirmed the importance of safe, \ntimely and affordable access to emergency and essential \nSOA care as a component of Universal Health Coverage.6 \nThis commitment was recently reaffirmed with the adop\u00ad\ntion of WHA resolution 76.2.7 SADC Member States led \nthe negotiations for the adoption of WHA68.15 and have \ncommitted to developing NSOAPs, sharing best practice \nthrough a \u2018peer review\u2019 mechanism that includes reporting \nprogress at annual SADC Health Ministers\u2019 meetings and \nparticipation within the SADC Technical Experts\u2019 Working \nGroup (SADC-TEWG) on SOA care. \nOf the 16 SADC Member States, 38% (n=6) have com\u00ad\npleted NSOAP development, while 62% (n=10) are at dif\u00ad\nferent stages of development of national surgical healthcare \npolicies as reported at the monthly SADC-TEWG Situation \nRoom meeting.8 Other African countries (Rwanda, \nEthiopia, and Nigeria) have implemented similar poli\u00ad\ncies.9\u201111 Globally, the Western Pacific Region has also de\u00ad\nveloped a Regional Action Framework for National Surgi\u00ad\ncal Planning and Development,12 Pakistan has published a \nNational Vision for Surgical Care13 and Ecuador has begun \ndeveloping an NSOAP \u2013 the first in Latin America.14 De\u00ad\nspite many national surgical plans being created worldwide, \nonly Ethiopia has performed an audit of the surgical health\u00ad\ncare improvement policy\u2019s implementation process.15 \nNotwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, progress in \nNSOAP development has been slower than anticipated.16 \nWith the expiry of the 2030 agenda for sustainable devel\u00ad\nopment approaching, it is important to elucidate barriers \nthat impede the development and implementation of na\u00ad\ntional surgical healthcare policies. Information delineating \nenabling or delaying factors could prove critical in the for\u00ad\nmulation of strategies to support and accelerate surgical \nhealth policy formulation in the region, and inform direc\u00ad\ntions that other countries might take. \nThis is a cross-sectional survey to identify barriers (lead\u00ad\nership, political, economic, logistical, administrative, tech\u00ad\nnical or other) to NSOAP policy development and imple\u00ad\nmentation in the 16 SADC Member States. The primary \naim is to describe the main barriers to NSOAP develop\u00ad\nment. Secondary aims are to identify (1) facilitators of \nNSOAP development and (2) barriers to NSOAP imple\u00ad\nmentation. \nMethods \nStudy design and participant inclusion criteria, survey in\u00ad\nstrument design, survey dissemination and administration \nplan, analysis plan, and ethics approval are reported as per \nthe Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys \n(CHERRIES), guidelines for reporting internet based e-sur\u00ad\nveys.17 \nStudy Design and Participants \nThis was a cross-sectional survey of stakeholders of surgi\u00ad\ncal care within SADC Member States. Invited stakeholder \ngroups included - but were not limited to - government, \nhospital management, healthcare professionals, non-gov\u00ad\nernmental organisations, academic institutions, profes\u00ad\nsional associations, World Health Organisation represen\u00ad\ntatives, and donors. There was no financial incentive; \nparticipation was purely voluntary. \nParticipants were recruited using purposive, snowball, \nand convenience sampling. The initial recruitment phase \nwas limited to recommended contacts within the SADC \nSOA community through the SADC-TEWG. Respondents \nsuggested expanding access via various SOA-specific \nWhatsApp group platforms to improve participation. A sec\u00ad\nond recruitment phase with an open survey link was \nlaunched, followed by a third phase of purposive follow-up \nof stakeholders from Member States that were under-repre\u00ad\nsented. \nSurvey Instrument \nWe designed a structured questionnaire (Appendix 1) com\u00ad\nprising the following sections: demographic information in\u00ad\ncluding country representation and stakeholder type; and \nrespondents\u2019 perceptions of 1) government support for \nNSOAPs; 2) existence of an NSOAP task force; 3) re\u00ad\nsources for NSOAP development; and 4) NSOAP devel\u00ad\nopment as per the domains of the NSOAP manual18: a) \nsituation analysis and baseline assessment; b) stakeholder \nengagement and priority setting; c) drafting and validation; \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n43\nd) monitoring and evaluation; e) financing; and f) gover\u00ad\nnance. For those respondents from countries in which an \nNSOAP already existed, there was a section on implemen\u00ad\ntation. \nThe survey was created in English. Translated versions \nwere available via a Google Chrome plugin for respondents \nin Angola (Portuguese), DRC, and Comoros (French). \nStudy data were collected, managed, and stored using se\u00ad\ncure REDCap software.19,20 Adaptive questioning utilising \nREDCap branching logic function was employed. The tool \nwas piloted by three individuals outside the design team to \nrefine the content, structure, branching logic, general use\u00ad\nability and technical functionality before final dissemina\u00ad\ntion. The survey could be completed via computer or smart\u00ad\nphone. \nUtilisation of the adaptive questioning technique pre\u00ad\ncluded a completeness check. Completion of at least six \nquestions was required for response inclusion; the maxi\u00ad\nmum number of questions was 76. The survey ranged from \n2-14 sections (pages). \nSurvey Dissemination and Administration \nPhase 1 occurred from September to October 2022. Known \nstakeholders within SADC were invited to participate via \nemail. The survey was launched at a SADC-TEWG meet\u00ad\ning and promoted via the SADC SOA WhatsApp group by \nits Chair and the study team. \nPhase 2, from November to December 2022, introduced \nan open recruitment process via WhatsApp to appropriate \ngroups, e.g. the Zambian Surgeons\u2019 professional network, \nthe Namibian NSOAP development group, and the Surgical \nSociety of Botswana network. \nDuring phase 3 (January to February 2023), purposive \nrecruitment of stakeholders from Member States that were \nunderrepresented took place. These individuals were iden\u00ad\ntified and contacted via email and/or WhatsApp. \nWe expressly permitted participants to complete the sur\u00ad\nvey more than once if responding for multiple member \nstates. The risk for duplicate entries could theoretically not \nbe excluded but there was no behavioural incentive for this. \nAnalysis \nResponses were evaluated for completeness. Due to the \nadaptive questioning technique, survey length differed be\u00ad\ntween participants. If a participant had not completed the \nentirety of their bespoke survey, but had completed at least \none section beyond demographic information, this was \ncounted as a partial response and included in the analysis \nas such. Participants were counted as having completed the \nsurvey in entirety if they completed all fields up to and \nnot including optional questions following the survey about \ncontinuing collaboration within the SADC-TEWG. \nWe did not use weights to improve representativeness \nbut conducted a post-hoc subgroup analysis of responses \nfrom the Republic of Zambia, as these accounted for 38% \nFigure 1. Flowchart of responses \nof the responses. Entries that did not have a minimum de\u00ad\nmographic data set (SADC Member State and stakeholder \ngroup) were excluded from analysis. Data were de-iden\u00ad\ntified prior to analysis. Basic descriptive statistics were \nconducted using Microsoft Excel for quantitative data. A \nthematic analysis for major themes was carried out for qual\u00ad\nitative responses. \nEthics \nIRB exemption was determined by the Institutional Review \nBoard of Harvard Medical School (IRB22-0262), and full \nethics approval granted by the Human Research Ethics \nCommittee \nof \nWitwatersrand \nUniversity \n(HREC: \nM220250). A participant information sheet was included as \nthe initial page of the survey, requiring affirmative consent \nbefore the survey could proceed. Only the research team \nhad access to the REDCap database. \nResults \nResponse and completion rates \nIn phase 1, individualised survey links were sent to 342 \nunique email addresses. Of these, 55 logged at least a partial \nresponse, equating to a response rate of 16%. This \nprompted phase 2 and 3 of recruitment. \nFollowing all recruitment phases, 216 participants \nopened the survey and 84% (n=182) completed at least the \nconsent form. Completion rate was 60% (109/182). An ad\u00ad\nditional 40 participants recorded partial responses. Over the \nthree periods of data collection, 149 partial and complete \nresponses were obtained (Figure 1). \nRespondent Demographics \nResponses were obtained from 87% (n=14) of countries; \nthere were no responses obtained from Mauritius or \nMozambique. Figure 2 graphically presents country-level \nrepresentation. Respondents represented the following \nstakeholders: 60% health care professionals (n=90), 24% \ngovernment (n=36) and 23% academic institutions (n=34). \nOf 149 respondents, 30% (n=45) respondents held member\u00ad\nships in multiple stakeholder groups (median 1; range 2-5) \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n44\nFigure 2.

Although respondents were often self-identified \nmembers of professional and governmental groups, all re\u00ad\nsponses were analysed as representing the viewpoint of the \nindividual rather than any organisation. \nFree text responses to \u2018strengths and \nweaknesses\u2019 questions \nThe survey requested that respondents express at least one \nstrength and one weakness of surgical services in their \ncountry. Responses were categorised thematically into re\u00ad\nsponses regarding infrastructure, SOA staffing, and out\u00ad\ncomes. In terms of strengths, respondents were optimistic \nabout the breadth and availability of procedures: 25% \n(n=31/124) respondents commented on availability of sur\u00ad\ngical procedures and operating theatre space, increasingly \nat district (level 1) or regional/provincial (level 2) hospitals. \nFurther, 11% (n=14) respondents commented on the exis\u00ad\ntence of a referral system and access to tertiary level care. \nTwenty-seven percent (n=34) of respondents indicated ad\u00ad\nequate numbers of staff exist, and that the number of spe\u00ad\ncialists, specialist training, and basic surgical training for \nnon-specialist doctors was increasing. Ten percent (n=12) \nof respondents commented on the commitment and passion \nof specialists to provide SOA care. Another strength was \nthe reported low- or no-cost surgical services for impover\u00ad\nished patients through government-led health programmes, \nwhich was mentioned in 7% (n=9) of responses. \nChallenges regarding infrastructure, equipment and \nmedical-surgical supply challenges were the most reported \nweakness. Twenty-eight percent (n=40/143) respondents \ncited inadequate, obsolete diagnostic and surgical equip\u00ad\nment and 17% (n=24) reported a lack of consumables and \nmedications as weaknesses of their surgical systems. In \naddition, 17% (n=24) commented on the persistent low \nnumber of specialist doctors and specialised ancillary staff, \nincluding nurses and scrub technicians. Respondents also \nflagged challenges with inequitable distribution of surgical \nservices between urban and rural regions, between rural re\u00ad\ngions, and an overall lack of policy or guidelines regard\u00ad\ning quality and provision of care. Despite the increasing \nscope of procedures offered, respondents indicated that ter\u00ad\ntiary centres were overwhelmed and there were long wait-\ntimes for emergency and elective procedures. One respon\u00ad\ndent wrote of \u2018significant waiting times both for elective as \nwell as emergency surgeries. Many patients do not have ad\u00ad\nequate access to surgical services and the delay contributes \nto morbidity and mortality\u2019. Interestingly, three respondents \nreported that reliance on private health systems resulted in \nlack of investment in public systems and thus poor quality \nof care for the uninsured population. One respondent stated: \n\u2018There is [a] HUGE gap between state (government) and \nprivate health care. Almost 88% patients use state facilities \nand only 12% private facilities. The resource allocation is \nless than 12% for government patients\u2019. \nPolitical Landscape, Task Force \nDevelopment, and Resources \nWhen asked about perceptions of the political will sur\u00ad\nrounding NSOAP development and implementation, 47% \n(n=56/119) stated that their government supported NSOAP \ndevelopment \u2018a little\u2019. Twenty-seven percent (n=32) re\u00ad\nported that their government \u2018supports and is driving\u2019 the \nNSOAP development process. \nThere were 135 responses with 30% (n=41) responding \n\u2018unknown\u2019 to whether a task force for NSOAP develop\u00ad\nment existed in their country. Of the other responses, 28% \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n45\n(n=35) believed that the NSOAP Development Task Force \nwas unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and 21% \n(n=28) believed that key members of the task force were \nredirected to COVID-19 efforts. Twenty-one percent of re\u00ad\nspondents (n=28) reported no task force existed in their \nrespective countries. Reasons cited were \u2018no champion to \nlead the NSOAP process\u2019, \u2018not enough interested people to \ncreate a task force\u2019, '\u2018stakeholders have competing interests \npreventing the formation of a cohesive working group\u2019 and \n\u2018lack of focus\u2019. Where there was a task force, 61% (n=40) \nreported coordination between members. \nStakeholders were asked to select which entities they \nbelieved provided financial and/or personnel resources for \nNSOAP development (Figure 3). Eight different potential \nsources of resources were offered (as well as the options \nof \u2018none\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019). Forty-three percent of respondents \n(n=64) reported provision of personnel resources; within \nthis group, the median number of selected sources was 3 \n(range 1-8) and total number of selections was 190. Per\u00ad\nsonnel assistance included support for data collection, pol\u00ad\nicy drafting, advocacy efforts, and similar tasks. Personnel \nresources were perceived to be sourced from national gov\u00ad\nernments (24%, n=45), domestic universities (20%, n=38), \nforeign universities (14%, n=27), and the SADC-TEWG \n(11%, n=21). Thirty-five percent of respondents (n=52) re\u00ad\nported financial provision. Within this group, the median \nnumber of selected sources was 2 (range 1-5) and the total \nnumber of selections was 103. National government con\u00ad\nstituted 25% (n=26) of selections; WHO constituted 23% \n(n=24), and international organisations like the World Bank \nconstituted 16% (n=16). \nFree text responses to factors that \naffected political support of NSOAP \ndevelopment \nFree text answers were elicited in response to the question \n\u2018Please specify any other factors that may have influenced \npolitical support of NSOAP development, and whether this \nhas resulted in an increase or decrease in support of NSOAP \ndevelopment\u2019. Respondents listed factors that they believed \nboth increased and decreased political support fairly \nequally. With regards to decreasing support, the most com\u00ad\nmonly cited reasons were high turnover of key personnel in \ngovernment positions and other health priorities (including \nCOVID-19) taking precedence over SOA care. Other fac\u00ad\ntors cited were decreasing donor support, other political pri\u00ad\norities (e.g. eastern DRC conflict), and lack of awareness of \nSOA care needs. Regarding factors that increased political \nsupport for NSOAP development, the most commonly re\u00ad\nported was the dedication of leadership and advocacy teams \nand personnel in putting pressure on the government. One \nrespondent wrote, \u2018The resilience of the technical team in \nadvocating for NSOAP development and implementation \nhas influenced the political leadership to pay more atten\u00ad\ntion\u2019. Others cited external pressure from NGOs to increase \naccess to SOA care, as well as restructuring of governmen\u00ad\ntal agencies and human resources providing increased ca\u00ad\npacity toward NSOAP development. \nNSOAP Development Barriers \nRespondents were asked whether an NSOAP process had \nbeen initiated in their country; of 73 respondents, 68% \n(n=50) said the process had been initiated, 8% (n=6) that it \nhad not been initiated, and 23% (n=17) were unsure. The \n50 respondents who were aware of an NSOAP process be\u00ad\ning initiated in their countries were asked to indicate which \nof the following domains presented challenges in NSOAP \ndevelopment: situational analysis and baseline assessment; \nstakeholder engagement and priority setting; drafting and \nvalidation; monitoring and evaluation; finance; governance; \nor none. Figure 4 provides a detailed account of all re\u00ad\nsponses and the specific components of each domain that \npresented a challenge in the NSOAP development process. \nFinancing, stakeholder engagement and priority setting, and \nsituational analysis and baseline assessment were the three \ncategories that were most often cited as having presented \nchallenges to NSOAP development. \nNSOAP Implementation \nThree countries had begun NSOAP implementation at the \ntime of survey distribution: Zambia, Tanzania, and Mada\u00ad\ngascar. Participant stakeholders from these countries were \nasked about barriers to implementation in addition to bar\u00ad\nriers to development. Of these, there were 34 responses \nregarding Ministry of Health support for implementation: \n59% (n=20) reported that the Ministry of Health supported \nimplementation \u2018a little\u2019, and 26% (n= 9) reported that the \nMinistry of Health \u2018supports and is driving the NSOAP im\u00ad\nplementation process.\u2019 In response to the question \u2018Has im\u00ad\nplementation gone to plan?\u2019 zero respondents said \u2018yes\u2019, \n21% (n=6) of 28 said \u2018no\u2019, and 50% (n=14) said \u2018partially\u2019. \nThe six respondents who responded \u2018no\u2019 and 12/14 \u2018par\u00ad\ntially\u2019 responses were submitted by Zambian respondents, \nas well as the majority of responses regarding implementa\u00ad\ntion barriers (90%, n=18/20). Of eight potential barriers, re\u00ad\nspondents indicated that seven were applicable (with 7-10 \nresponses for each) in their context. Mirroring the stated \nbarriers for NSOAP development, there were issues around \nfinance and personnel resources as well as inadequate lead\u00ad\nership and governance. However, there were additional im\u00ad\nplementation barriers around the NSOAP not being trans\u00ad\nlated into an actionable plan, and inadequate integration \nof the NSOAP into the National Health Strategic Plans \n(NHSP). Notably, unlike the responses to the questions \nabout barriers to NSOAP development, respondents from \nall 3 countries (Zambia, Madagascar, and Tanzania) said \nthat COVID-19 did, in fact, divert resources from NSOAP \nimplementation (Figure 5). \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n46\nFigure 3. Respondent perception of sources of financial and personnel resources for NSOAP development \nAbbreviations: WHO - World Health Organisation; SADC-TEWG - Southern African Development Community Technical Experts\u2019 Working Group; govt - government; NGO - non-governmental organ\u00ad\nisation \nNSOAP Development Facilitators and \nPositive Effects of NSOAP Implementation \nRegarding factors that facilitated formulation of an NSOAP \ndevelopment strategy, of 119 responses, 39% (n=46) re\u00ad\nported the presence of established leadership as a driving \nfactor (Figure 6). Regarding positive effects of NSOAP im\u00ad\nplementation, or positive changes in the status of SOA care \nin their country since implementation was due to start, 18% \nreported benefits in improved access to emergency surgical \ncare (n=13/72), 21% reported improved provider workforce \nwith regards to SAO specialists (n=15) and 13% with re\u00ad\ngard to non-specialists including nurses (n=9). Eleven per\u00ad\ncent (n=8) reported that there has not been any positive \nchange in surgical care since their NSOAP was published. \nNegative aspects of NSOAP Development \nor Negative Changes in Surgical Health \nCare \nRespondents were asked about the negative effects of \nNSOAP development and implementation, as well as other \nnegative changes to surgical systems they have perceived \nsince the time NSOAP implementation began. There were \nno responses from Madagascar and Tanzania; a few free-\ntext responses were given by Zambian respondents. These \nresponses included concerns about lack of specialist train\u00ad\ning, decreased number of specialists compared to increasing \nworkload, lack of funding for operations and need for pa\u00ad\ntients to purchase their own surgical supplies, and depleted \nsurgical support services leading to increased case cancella\u00ad\ntions. On a structural level, one respondent reported a lack \nof engagement and advocacy for surgical healthcare at the \ncommunity level. \nZambia Subgroup Analysis \nSince 38% (n=56) of the 149 total responses were reported \nfor Zambia, these responses were analysed separately as a \nsubgroup as well as within the complete response analyses \nreported above. Responses in all categories closely mir\u00ad\nrored the responses received for the entire cohort. A com\u00ad\nparison of the responses from the Zambian subgroup and \nthe total dataset are reported in Figure 7. \nRegarding resources, respondents perceived higher pro\u00ad\nvision of personnel resources (n=48) than financial re\u00ad\nsources (n=30). Likewise, personnel resources were per\u00ad\nceived as being supplied by the national government (31%, \nn=15) and universities (33%, n=16), whereas financial re\u00ad\nsources were perceived to be supplied by WHO (17%, \nn=5), foreign governments (23%, n=7), or other interna\u00ad\ntional organisations e.g. the World Bank (23%, n=7). Two \nother sources of personnel resources mentioned were surgi\u00ad\ncal societies and the Zambia Medical Association. \nRegarding implementation of Zambia\u2019s NSOAP, 12 of \nthe respondents reported being involved with the imple\u00ad\nmentation process and 23 reported that they were not in\u00ad\nvolved. \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n47\nFigure 4. Barriers to NSOAP development mapped to domains of the NSOAP manual \nPlease note the overall response rates were different for each of the six domains, so these charts do not use a uniform scale. Abbreviations: \u2191 - increase; \u2193 - decrease; DC - data collection; tech \u2013 techni\u00ad\ncal; SH - stakeholders; M&E - monitoring and evaluation; govt - government; MoH - Ministry of Health; SOA - surgery, obstetrics and anaesthesia. \nDiscussion \nGovernment decision agendas depend on the alignment of \nproblem, policy, and political streams.21 Concerning surgi\u00ad\ncal healthcare, the problem remains as urgent as ever, so \nan opening of a policy window relies on having enough \ngovernmental political will to drive successful policy re\u00ad\nform. The gains are potentially far-reaching: the top-down \ndirective to strengthen a surgical system would ultimately \nstrengthen the entire national health system.22 However, \nour survey results indicate the perception of limited po\u00ad\nlitical conviction for national surgical healthcare policy in \nmany SADC Member States. Taken at face value, it raises \nthe question of why there is so little impetus to strengthen \nSOA care. This study was not designed to explore that spe\u00ad\ncific issue, but Mhazo et al have specifically looked into \nthe \u2018lack of political will\u2019 for health reform in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, elucidating more specific drivers: \u20181) the distribu\u00ad\ntion of costs and benefits arising from policy reforms, 2) the \nform and expression of power among actors, 3) the desire \nto win or stay in government, 4) political ideologies, 5) elite \ninterests and 6) policy diffusion\u2019.23 Other potential factors \ninclude a lack of state capacity24 in LMIC governments and \npotentially a lack of lobbying power.25 However, this study \nindicates that where there is an existing strategy to incorpo\u00ad\nrate adequate minimal standards for surgical care within the \nnational health plan, the key driver has been perceived as \nestablished leadership of the process within the Ministry of \nHealth. \nIn terms of the technical process of NSOAP formulation, \nfinance was the most commonly cited component that pre\u00ad\nsented difficulty. This was principally thought to be due \nto the absence of an allocated budget for surgical system \nstrengthening within the Ministry of Health and a lack of \naccurate costing data. Notably, there were relatively few \nrespondents who thought that a lack of economics or fi\u00ad\nnancial expertise was the main cause. Most respondents re\u00ad\nported being unaware how the NSOAP process was being \nresourced. It is no surprise that finance was perceived as the \ngreatest challenge; LMICs are, by definition, resource-lim\u00ad\nited; and much of sub-Saharan Africa continues to be reliant \non external aid to finance healthcare services.26,27 Further\u00ad\nmore, formulating a policy without the certainty of funding \nfor implementation might be perceived by the electorate as \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n48\nFigure 5. Barriers to NSOAP implementation: Respondents from Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar \nFigure 6. Facilitators of NSOAP Development \nan empty or broken promise and compromise the prospect \nof re-election for the sitting government. \nStakeholder engagement was the second most com\u00ad\nmonly cited challenge. Within this theme, there have been \ndifficulties engaging with key stakeholders from both pub\u00ad\nlic and private sectors, and agreeing who these key stake\u00ad\nholders are. Another highlighted difficulty is competing in\u00ad\nterests between key stakeholders. Given the diversity of \nstakeholders, it goes without question that different goals \nexist for SOA care delivery and development. Within this \ndiverse cohort, there must be intentionality in the choices \nmade regarding which voices to include and which to pri\u00ad\noritise. This can only happen if clear government leadership \nof the process is established. \nVoluntary participation inevitably gives rise to self-se\u00ad\nlection bias; 60% of respondents were healthcare providers, \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n49\nFigure 7. Comparison of Zambian Subgroup Responses vs All SADC Responses in Demographics, Policy \nSupport and Leadership, and Development Barriers. \n24% represented government and 23% from academic insti\u00ad\ntutions (with overlap of these cohorts), but there was min\u00ad\nimal representation from intergovernmental organisations \n(such as the World Bank and World Health Organisation) \nand no representation from donor agencies or private in\u00ad\ndustry. This could relate to dissemination techniques, and/\nor the level of engagement from these stakeholders with re\u00ad\ngard to NSOAP development. The authors re-evaluated the \ninitial closed survey methodology in light of the low re\u00ad\nsponse rate (16%) and general feedback from participants \nbut ultimately, responses were limited to what networks \ncould be accessed. Frontline healthcare providers would be \nunlikely to access networks of the private sector, potential \ndonors, government treasury and intergovernmental organ\u00ad\nisations, to whom the authors also lacked direct access. \nThe lack of engagement with these sectors is in itself \na barrier. As previously highlighted, innovative plans to \nincorporate surgical care into national health care cannot \nbe formulated and implemented without appropriate fund\u00ad\ning, making potential funders (both domestic and interna\u00ad\ntional) some of the most influential stakeholders. However, \nthey are notably absent from the discussion. Furthermore, \nthere was no representation of civil society among the re\u00ad\nspondents. To our knowledge, patient representative groups \nhave not been formally consulted for any of the six pre\u00ad\nviously-published national surgical plans in the SADC re\u00ad\ngion. \nSelf-selection bias and dissemination via the WhatsApp \nplatform also resulted in uneven representation from differ\u00ad\nent countries within SADC, with Zambia providing 38% of \nthe total responses whilst none were elicited from Mozam\u00ad\nbique or Mauritius. The diversity between SADC Member \nStates should not be underestimated, and thus skewed rep\u00ad\nresentation is a significant limitation. The post-hoc sub\u00ad\nanalysis of Zambian responses was performed to address \nthis, which largely reflected the findings of the overall co\u00ad\nhort. There was one notable difference in that financing was \nthe third most cited barrier to development rather than the \nfirst. This finding could be due to the leadership and en\u00ad\ngagement of the Zambian Ministry of Health in the NSOAP \ndevelopment process, and local funding was made available \nfor policy development, overcoming immediate financial \nbarriers. \nThe implication of this study is that advocating for na\u00ad\ntional surgical healthcare policy to be formulated is not \nsufficient to achieve policy development, much less im\u00ad\nplementation and achieving measurable impact on popu\u00ad\nlation health. The financial barrier is the most significant, \nand there are lessons to learn from the wider Global Health \ncommunity in this regard. Firstly, the priority should be to \nincrease domestic government health financing for obvious \nsustainability reasons28; but secondly, donor agencies (such \nas PEPFAR and the Global Fund) have been transformative \nin recent decades.29,30 The surgical community has much \nto learn from the positive impact of such funds, as well as \nthe unintended negative consequences on health systems31 \nwhich should be mitigated against. It follows that the next \nstep is to engage decision makers and funders (national \ntreasury, intergovernmental and non-governmental organi\u00ad\nsations, philanthropies, private industry, etc.) from the very \nbeginning, and align their interests to envision a sustainable \nfinancing model for surgical healthcare. \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n50\nThe NSOAP Manual,18 in its static form, is intended to \nbe a template to guide LMICs through the technical process \nof creating a policy to address lack of access to emer\u00ad\ngency and essential surgical, obstetric, and anaesthesia care, \nincluding trauma, critical and perioperative nursing care. \nWhilst many countries have embarked upon this process, \nlack of robust monitoring and evaluation processes with \nstandardised metrics has made it difficult to gauge what im\u00ad\npact this has made on surgical healthcare provision. The \nend goal of any intervention in the global surgery space is \nto increase access to and quality of surgical healthcare. Pol\u00ad\nicy formulation is a vehicle to support that aim, rather than \nan end in itself. In order to ensure that national surgical \nplanning process achieves the goals of improved surgical \nhealthcare for all, it is critical to incorporate ongoing eval\u00ad\nuation of the policy against its stated goals as part of its de\u00ad\nvelopment process. \nConclusions \nAmong LMICs, development of national strategies and spe\u00ad\ncific plans to implement appropriate levels of surgical \nhealthcare has been slow. In seeking to delineate barriers \n(and appreciating inter-country variability), financing and \npolitical will have emerged as the most commonly cited \nchallenges within SADC. Decision makers and potential \nfunders should be engaged early, to envision a sustainable \nfinancing model for surgical healthcare. \nSubmitted: July 24, 2023 EAT, Accepted: May 20, 2024 \nEAT \nBarriers to National Surgical Healthcare Policy Development & Implementation in the Southern African De\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n51\nReferences \n1.

Extra-ocular extension is rare, but the risk of \nsystemic metastasis increases with late diagnosis. We report a case of retinoblastoma metastasis to the forearm six years \nafter the first diagnosis was made and treated. It is believed to add to our understanding of retinoblastoma metastasis, and \nthis relatively uncommon disease course. \nIntroduction \nRetinoblastoma is the most common childhood intraocular \nmalignant tumor.1,2 The majority of global case burden \ncomes from low and middle-income countries associated \nwith guarded outcomes.3 Retinoblastoma can be heritable \nsecondary to germ-line mutation of the RB1 gene. This pat\u00ad\ntern is common in the early years of life and is mostly \nunilateral, unlike a non-heritable form which appears later. \nSeveral studies revealed that retinoblastoma affects nearly \n1 in 16,000 \u2013 18,000 births, with an incidence of 7000 \u2013 \n8000 new cases yearly. The incidence is three times higher \nin children under five than in those under three.4 The mean \nage of diagnosis for retinoblastoma is around 1 year old for \nbilateral and 2 years for unilateral disease.5 A nationwide \nstudy in Uganda revealed a 45% 3-year survival rate com\u00ad\npared to 100 % in countries with no resource limitation.6 \nThe incidence of retinoblastoma is around 2310 in East \nAfrica second only to the West Africa region with 7824 \nincidences. There is a trend towards delayed presentation \nand diagnosis, treatment discontinuity by the family, and \nsignificant gap in multidisciplinary treatment resulting in \nincreased risk of disease relapse, systemic metastasis and \npoorer prognosis with a mortality of 40-70 % in low income \ncountries.7 Clinical presentation of patients includes white \nocular reflex, decreased vision, eye pain, and Glaucoma.8 \nMicroscopic histological examinations show small hyper\u00ad\nchromatic cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio \nwith multifocal areas of necrosis and calcification. Tumor \ninvasion of the surrounding structures appears as solid nests \nof cells infiltrating surrounding borders, and no necrosis.9 \nPatients with delayed diagnosis have a higher risk of \ndeveloping metastatic disease, and studies have shown ex\u00ad\ntraocular retinoblastoma occurring at a mean age of 33 and \n38 months. Extrascleral extension of primary tumors is the \nmost important risk factor for distant metastasis, due to ac\u00ad\ncess to the vascular and lymphatic system outside the eye.5 \nNearly all retinal recurrences appear within three years of \nthe initial treatment and follow-up, with a 6-45% recur\u00ad\nrence following all options of initial treatment.10,11 It can \nalso spread to the bones and lymph nodes and unlike all the \nother malignancies, rarely to the lungs.4 Bilateral tumours \nare discovered and treated at a younger age than unilateral \nRetinoblastoma.

Examination revealed a mildly ten\u00ad\nder, firm circumferential swelling over the distal third of the \nleft forearm, her distal neurovascular status was normal and \ncomparable to the right side (Figure 1). She has a surgically \nenucleated eye on the left side, with no other significant \nfindings elicited. Imaging of the forearm revealed a perme\u00ad\native lesion over the whole length of the radius suggesting \na possible presentation of osteosarcoma and she was subse\u00ad\nquently admitted for open biopsy (Figure 2). \nHer medical history begins with an initial presentation \nto an ophthalmology clinic with a complaint of bilateral \neye leucorrhoea at 11 months of age. After a diagnosis of \nextensive intraocular retinoblastoma was made both eyes \nwere surgically enucleated. The initial pathology report of \nthe surgically removed eyes and tumour showed retinoblas\u00ad\ntoma with extension to the uveal tract, and no involvement \nof the optic nerve. Post-operatively 6 cycles of first-line \nchemotherapy regimen including Vincristin, Etoposide, and \nCarboplatin was given for its high-risk pathology. Subse\u00ad\nquently, a follow-up MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) \nshowed no radiologic evidence of recurrence or residual en\u00ad\nhancing tumor in the orbit, or signs of intracranial involve\u00ad\nment (Fig 3). \nAt the age of 4 years and 3 months, she came back with \na complaint of left eye swelling. A computed Tomography \n(CT) scan showed a left eye globe soft tissue mass sug\u00ad\ngestive of Retinoblastoma and was treated with External \nBeam radiotherapy for 3 weeks. A year into her follow up \nshe came with an acute lower back pain radiating down to \nher thighs bilaterally, neck swelling, and difficulty walk\u00ad\ning. Neck and Abdominal Ultrasound showed bilateral cer\u00ad\nvical, mesenteric and para-aortic lymphadenopathy. Bone \nmarrow biopsy was taken which demonstrated normal tri\u00ad\nlineage hematopoiesis, and Thoraco-Lumbar spinal MRI \nwas suggestive of vertebral metastasis evidenced by L2 \nvertebral collapse (Fig 4). In light of the new diagnosis \nof vertebral and Lymph node metastasis, she was treated \nwith high-dose intravenous dexamethasone, and 6 cycles \nof combination chemo-radio therapy including vincristine, \ndoxorubicin, cyclophosphamid, and MESNA. The patient \nhad no residual complications from the vertebral metastasis, \nand systemic studies didn\u2019t show involvement of other \nbody parts. \nAfter 14 months of the new development, she started de\u00ad\nveloping left forearm pain, and swelling. During her initial \nadmission, an incisional biopsy was done and histological \nsections were indicative of a round blue cell tumour likely \nretinoblastoma (Fig 5). Immunohistochemistry was done \nwhich revealed tumour cells expressing NSE and Synapto\u00ad\nFig 1.

Since 1996 sys\u00ad\ntemic chemotherapy replaced radiotherapy due to its con\u00ad\ncern of inducing secondary cancers, especially if alkylating \nagents are used.13 The most frequent site for distant metas\u00ad\ntases, through the systemic blood flow, is the bone marrow \nwhich may appear as primary bone tumours and needs to \nbe carefully investigated.14 Both Focal and diffuse involve\u00ad\nment of bones and bone marrow can occur, most commonly \nwithin two years of diagnosis as metastases in later years \nare extremely rare. Retinoblastoma patients are known to \nhave an increased risk of secondary malignant neoplasms \n(SMN) like osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, spindle cell \nsarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, rhabdomyosar\u00ad\ncoma, angiosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and PNET (Primitive \nneuro-ectodermal tumours), typically occurring after 8\u201315 \nyears of latency. Thorough investigations using histologi\u00ad\ncal, immunologic, and imaging is required to distinguish \nbetween these two entities. The Involvement of multiple \nbones supports the diagnosis of metastases than multifocal \nSMN.14,15 \nMetastatic retinoblastoma outside the Central Nervous \nSystem is rare and diagnosis is hard due to similar his\u00ad\ntologic appearance with other bone tumours.16 Metastases \nto extremities appear radiologicaly as permeative bone de\u00ad\nstruction and periosteal reaction with a tendency to be bilat\u00ad\neral.17 Histologically they present as small round or polyg\u00ad\nonal cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty \ncytoplasm. They typically form rosettes where tumour cells \nsurround a central basement membrane called Flexner-\nWintersteiner rosettes. Both local and distance metastasis \nwith intracranial extension including treatment-induced \nsecondary tumors are known to be poor prognostic charac\u00ad\nteristics.18 Metastatic retinoblastoma has been rarely cur\u00ad\nable, a reason for the poor prognosis associated with metas\u00ad\ntasis. This is changing recently with the advent of a \nmultimodal treatment including multi-agent chemotherapy, \nand radiotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation \nfollowed by high-dose chemotherapy to consolidate the re\u00ad\nsponse, as seen from different case series.19 \nBilateral Retinoblastoma with Lumbar Spine and Forearm Metastasis, Six Years after the Initial Presentatio\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n6\nFig 5. Sections showing nests and sheets of moderately pleomorphic round blue cells with infiltration of the \nbony trabecular spaces, features suggest round blue cell tumor. \nStudies have shown initial diagnosis before two years of \nage and subretinal seeds at diagnosis to be predictive of re\u00ad\ncurrence.11 It is evident that our patient\u2019s age during her \ninitial presentation has increased her risk of recurrence and \nthe authors believe there might be a possibility of missed \nsub-retinal seeding initially. Due to her initial treatment \nwith radiotherapy and alkylating agents, she is also believed \nto have an equal risk for developing secondary tumors in\u00ad\ncluding osteosarcoma, which is an important differential. \nAs seen in this case having access to advanced histological \ninvestigations including immune histo-chemistry studies is \ncritical in differentiating between the possible causes in \nsuch presentation. Repeated exposure to radiation including \nfrom an Initial treatment with external beam radiotherapy, \nand repeated radiologic investigations is related to an in\u00ad\ncreased risk of recurrence especially in children with hered\u00ad\nitary retinoblastoma. Thus new recommendations include \nminimizing repeated exposure to imaging modalities, opt\u00ad\ning for MRI as an initial evaluation tool instead of a CT \nscan, and utilizing alternative conservative measures is in \nplace.20 \nEven if new and advanced treatment regimens are not \nreadily available in this setting we believe local control \nof the disease process and post-surgical chemotherapy will \ngive patients the best possible outcome. We have also ob\u00ad\nserved delays in reaching a definitive diagnosis, and the \nlack of a multi-disciplinary approach to treat such patients \nhas a direct impact on the prognosis of our patients. In ad\u00ad\ndition, evidences suggests lifelong follow-up of children \ntreated for retinoblastoma is warranted to help children \nwith societal integration, follow-up of late recurrences, and \nparental counseling for genetic testing.21 Physicians in re\u00ad\nsource-limited settings are encouraged to advocate for the \nestablishment of early detection facilities, and lifelong fol\u00ad\nlow-up plans for patients with retinoblastoma. \nCONCLUSION \nIn conclusion it is important to consider recurrence of \nretinoblastoma in patient with new onset swelling in un\u00ad\nusual sites even after years of their initial presentation. It \nis also important to have lifelong follow up for children \nwith retinoblastoma in order to timely diagnose and treat \npatients. \nAcknowledgement \nWe would like to thank the parents of the child for allowing \nus to study the case. \nFinancial Support and Sponsorship \nNone. \nConflict of Interest \nThe authors have no conflict of interest to reveal. \nSubmitted: December 01, 2022 EAT, Accepted: August \n25, 2024 EAT \nBilateral Retinoblastoma with Lumbar Spine and Forearm Metastasis, Six Years after the Initial Presentatio\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n7\nReferences \n1.

While the overall global incidence and mortality of CRC have declined due to population-based screening \nprograms, the rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) in individuals under 50 has increased sharply. The reasons behind \nthis alarming trend remain unclear. Although hereditary cancer syndromes can predispose individuals to EOCRC, the majority \nof these cases are sporadic, and known lifestyle risk factors such as diet, smoking, and alcohol alone do not fully explain the \nrise. This phenomenon is global and affects both males and females. \nA low clinical index of suspicion in young adults often leads to delayed diagnosis, resulting in the detection of CRC at advanced \nstages, which contributes to poorer outcomes, particularly in younger patients. In this case report, we describe a 19-year-old \nmale who presented with acute abdominal distention and bloody diarrhea. Imaging revealed an obstructive colorectal tumor \nwith extensive metastasis to the mesentery, omentum, liver, stomach, and anterior abdominal wall. An emergency colostomy \nwas performed to relieve the obstruction, but the patient ultimately succumbed to the aggressive nature of the disease nine \ndays later. \nThis case underscores the importance of recognizing colorectal cancer in young patients and raises awareness of the need \nfor early diagnosis and intervention. By increasing vigilance for EOCRC in both primary and tertiary care settings, healthcare \nproviders can improve patient outcomes through timely referrals and treatment. \nBACKGROUND \nColorectal carcinoma (CRC) constitutes aggressive cancers \nof the colon and rectum, and it is the third most common \ncancer among men and the second most common among \nwomen globally. CRC incidence varies globally, with the \nhighest incidence reported in developed countries.1 How\u00ad\never, recent data shows that CRC incidence rates in de\u00ad\nveloping countries, including African countries, are on the \nrise.2 Several factors have been attributed to the increase \nin incidence rates, including genetic predisposition, dietary \npractices such as increased intake of energy-dense foods, \nurbanization associated with a sedentary lifestyle, and obe\u00ad\nsity.1,2 \nCRC in children and young adults has been reported to \nnot be common albeit in a few cases that have been re\u00ad\nported. It has been estimated that 1\u20132 children and/or ado\u00ad\nlescents are diagnosed with CRC in 1 million people glob\u00ad\nally. However, the incidence appears to be increasing.3 It \nis estimated that only 1% of all CRC occur in patients less \nthan 30 years.4 The age-adjusted incidence rate of CRC \nin the population of adults is said to be 43.7 people per 1 \nmillion. A trend of increasing incidence of CRC has been \nobserved in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 Our recent works \nin northern Tanzania found a higher incidence of CRC \nin younger individuals, and 90% of the patients presented \nwith advanced disease stages, hence the poor prognosis.5\u20117 \nCRCs are generally rare among teens especially in the ab\u00ad\nsence of known risk factors such as a positive family his\u00ad\ntory of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, familial adeno\u00ad\nmatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer \nsyndrome.2 The clinical features are generally similar in all \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

In the past, a myriad of de\u00ad\nscriptive terms has been used to indicate the mucin-pro\u00ad\nducing phenotype, including colloid carcinoma, gelatinous \ncarcinoma, or degenerative carcinoma. Mucinous adenocar\u00ad\ncinomas are clinically, morphologically, and molecularly \ndifferent from conventional adenocarcinomas, and affect \nyounger individuals, and they are more likely to be asso\u00ad\nciated with Lynch syndrome (LS).8 Mucinous adenocarci\u00ad\nnomas are a histological subtype of CRC characterized by \nsecreting extracellular mucin. Mucinous adenocarcinomas \nare divided into two categories: (i) extracellular subtype; is \ncharacterized by tumor cells floating freely in large pools \nof mucin. The cells that are floating in the mucin often \nhave a bland histologic appearance. (ii) intracellular sub\u00ad\ntype; is morphologically identical to the signet cell can\u00ad\ncer seen in the stomach. The signet cell variant behaves \nvery aggressively, and it has a poor prognosis.8,9 Mucinous \nadenocarcinomas, including signet cell cancers, account for \napproximately 10% of colorectal cancers. Compared with \nnon-mucinous CRCs, mucinous carcinomas usually present \nat a more advanced stage, they have more extensive perirec\u00ad\ntal spread, they show a greater incidence of lymph node in\u00ad\nvolvement, and they tend to have an overall poorer prog\u00ad\nnosis.8 Among the mucinous tumors, the extracellular type \nis much more common than the intracellular, or signet cell \ntype. \nMucinous tumors are characterized by the overexpres\u00ad\nsion of the mucin gene MUC2 and the more frequent ec\u00ad\ntopic expression of gastric mucin MUC5AC, which is me\u00ad\ndiated \nby \nthe \ntranscription \nfactor \nSOX2. \nThe \noverexpression of MUC2 is driven by the hypomethylation \nof the MUC2 promoter, contributing to the mucin-produc\u00ad\ning phenotype seen in these tumors. This molecular sig\u00ad\nnature is important for understanding the pathogenesis and \npotential therapeutic targets in mucinous tumors.9 The \nprognostic value of mucinous histology remains controver\u00ad\nsial, however, several literatures report they are associated \nwith poor prognosis.8 \nMucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is most commonly \nfound in the proximal colon, where it is frequently diag\u00ad\nnosed at more advanced stages, contributing to its poorer \nprognosis. The larger calibre of the proximal colon allows \ntumors to grow significantly before symptoms appear. Ad\u00ad\nditionally, mucinous adenocarcinomas are reported to have \na poorer response to chemotherapy compared to non-muci\u00ad\nnous variants.10 Our case is unusual as the mucinous adeno\u00ad\ncarcinoma was located distally, highlighting a rare presen\u00ad\ntation of this pathology. MRI is usually helpful in detecting \nthis unusual CRC as they characterized by a low signal \nintensity in T1-weighted images and a significant hyper\u00ad\nintense signal in T2-weighted images. Non-mucinous col\u00ad\norectal adenocarcinoma displays an intermediate signal in\u00ad\ntensity in T2-weighted images on the other hand. On CT \nscan, they are typically distinguished by a thickened in\u00ad\ntestinal wall, a thickened gut mucosa, and the presence of \nlow-density cystic lesions. Additionally, these tumors show \nnon-significant enhancement in the arterial phase compared \nto normal muscle, aiding in their identification and differ\u00ad\nentiation from other types of CRC.10 \nLS is characterized by predisposition to colorectal, en\u00ad\ndometrial, and other cancers and is caused by inherited \npathogenic variants affecting the DNA mismatch repair \n(MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. LS1 and \nLS2 are both associated with MMR malfunction and mi\u00ad\ncrosatellite instability.11 The prognosis is generally poor in \nthe pediatric group, as reported in the literature, however, \nlittle has been published.8 Herein, we present an uncommon \ncase of advanced mucinous CRC in a teenager. \nCASE PRESENTATION \nA 19-year-old male patient was referred to our facility from \na primary health care facility with a presentation of ab\u00ad\ndominal distension for 3 weeks accompanied by early sati\u00ad\nety and bloody diarrhea. The symptoms were progressive. \nThese symptoms were preceded by a 5-month history of di\u00ad\narrhea, intermittent episodes of constipation, and uninten\u00ad\ntional weight loss. During the illness, he tried various over-\nthe-counter medications without relief. His past medical \nhistory was otherwise unremarkable. There was no familial \nhistory of gastrointestinal/breast/endometrial/prostate can\u00ad\ncers, and he denied a history of consuming alcohol and to\u00ad\nbacco. \nOn physical examination, he was conscious, afebrile, \nmildly pale, not jaundiced, with bilateral pitting lower limb \nedema. He was wasted and undernourished as most of his \nbonny prominences were appreciated. The vital signs were \nwithin normal limits. His abdomen was grossly distended, \nnon-tender, no organomegaly, hypertympanic on percus\u00ad\nsion, and exaggerated bowel sounds were appreciated on \nauscultation. On rectal examination, a hard mass easily \nbleeding and completely obstructing the distal rectum was \nfelt hence could not go above it and was approximately 6cm \nfrom the anal verge. A respiratory examination revealed re\u00ad\nduced air entry on the left side with a dull percussion note. \nInvestigations \nHis complete blood count showed a hemoglobin of 9.4 g/\ndl (microcytic and hypochromic), leucocyte count of 9.22 \n\u00d7 109/l and a platelet count of 142\u00d7109/L. A plain chest x-\nray revealed approximately 50% left pleural effusion (Fig\u00ad\nure 1), and abdominal-pelvic ultrasound concluded ascites, \nan ill-defined heterogenous pelvic mass with mild ascites. \nA contrasted CT-scan of the chest and abdomen showed \nsymmetrical mural wall thickening measuring 4.2 cm of the \nAdvanced Mucinous Colorectal Carcinoma in a Teenager: A Case Report of a Changing Age Paradigm\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n10\nFigure 1. Plain chest x-ray showing left sided pleural \neffusion (blue arrow) \nsigmoid, upper, mid, and distal rectum measuring 16 cm in \nlength, suggestive of a rectosigmoid tumor. The tumor was \ncausing large bowel obstruction with ascites, and left sided \npleural effusion (Figure 2). \nManagement \nHe was transfused with one unit of whole blood (450 mL), \nand a left-sided thoracostomy tube was placed to drain \nthe pleural effusion. He was then taken for an emergency \ncolostomy to relieve the obstruction. The abdomen was \nopened through a upper midline incision. Intraoperatively, \napproximately 2 liters of hemorrhagic ascites were found. \nA hard, irregular pelvic mass, white in color, was identified, \nextending from the rectum to the anal canal and causing ob\u00ad\nstruction of the colon. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were \nnoted on the bowel mesentery, extending to its root, as well \nas in the paraaortic and celiac regions. Peritoneal metasta\u00ad\nsis was observed on the mesentery, omentum, liver, stom\u00ad\nach, and anterior abdominal wall, consistent with Stage \nIV disease (cT4NxM1). A double-barrel mid-transverse \ncolostomy was created, and a biopsy was taken. \nHistopathology revealed an infiltrative tumor composed \nof atypical glandular structures, with strips of tumor cells \nfloating in large extracellular mucin lakes consistent with \nmucinous adenocarcinoma with omental metastasis, \npT4NxM1 (Figure 3). \nOutcome and follow-up \nHis post-operative recovery was not promising, was man\u00ad\naged in the surgical ICU with intravenous fluids, antibi\u00ad\notics, analgesia and 450 mL of whole blood transfusion as \nper local protocol, and unfortunately, he succumbed nine \nFigure 2.

Conse\u00ad\nquently, there is a need for CRC screening in children and \nyoung adults, especially those with a family history of the \ndisease.6 Furthermore, clinicians should ensure that all pa\u00ad\ntients, including children and young adults showing any \nsigns or symptoms of CRC, are thoroughly evaluated and \nclosely followed to detect and treat the disease at its early \nstages. \nCRC incidence is increasing globally among the \nyounger generation, with a high fatality rate, however, it\u2019s \nlargely preventable. Screening can reduce mortality rates, \nespecially among young people, aged under 50 years. Im\u00ad\nplementing proven screening measures and developing in\u00ad\nnovative risk assessment methods can help reduce CRC \nrisk, especially in developing countries.1 In recent decades, \nthere has been a steady decline in CRC incidence among \nthe older population, which contrasts sharply with the rising \nincidence in young adults. CRC is increasingly recognized \nas an indicator of epidemiological change and socioeco\u00ad\nnomic shifts. The incidence and mortality rates of CRC are \nrising in low- and middle-income countries, in stark con\u00ad\ntrast to the trends observed in developed nations. For ex\u00ad\nample, data from the Kampala Cancer Registry highlight a \ndramatic increase in CRC rates. Specifically, in Tanzania, \nthere has been a six-fold rise in the incidence of CRC.12 \nThe authors found that patients presented at late stage of \nCRC, secondly there were younger patients diagnosed with \nCRC and thirdly there was a low rate of diagnostic \ncolonoscopy on CRC patients. This not only shows a shift \nin the presentation of age but also a shift towards rise in \nnon-communicable diseases in developing regions.12 \nEarly-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has now be\u00ad\ncome the second most common cancer and the third leading \ncause of cancer-related deaths in younger populations. Sim\u00ad\nilar upward trends are seen in Europe and North America, \nwith a notable rise in distal colon and rectal cancers. A de\u00ad\ntailed analysis from 20 European countries revealed an an\u00ad\nnual increase in CRC incidence by 7.9% in individuals aged \n20\u201329 years, 4.9% among those aged 30\u201339, and 1.6% in \nthe 40\u201349 age group from 2004 to 2016. This data under\u00ad\nscores the urgency of addressing the rising burden of CRC \nin younger populations.13 \nEarly-onset CRC is a highly heterogeneous disease, with \nhereditary genetic syndromes accounting for only a small \nproportion of cases, while the majority are classified as spo\u00ad\nradic.14 Mortality rates are higher in younger CRC patients \ncompared to their elderly counterparts. This trend may be \nexplained by two key factors: earlier exposure to known \nrisk factors in the younger generation compared to previous \nones, and the fact that neoplasms appearing at a younger \nage are often biologically more aggressive.15 \nIn addition to well-known risk factors such as inflam\u00ad\nmatory bowel disease and hereditary syndromes linked to \nCRC, other factors may contribute to the rising incidence of \nearly-onset colorectal cancer. Lifestyle changes, including \nincreased alcohol consumption, a sedentary lifestyle, high \nred meat intake, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, may par\u00ad\ntially explain this trend. However, current epidemiologic \ndata are insufficient to establish a definitive correlation be\u00ad\ntween these factors and early-onset CRC.16 \nVarious screening tests are available for CRC, each with \nits own advantages and disadvantages, and the quality of \nevidence supporting these tests varies. Common methods \ninclude guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs), fe\u00ad\ncal immunochemical tests (FITs), flexible sigmoidoscopy, \nand colonoscopy, among others.17,18 While these screening \nmethods are valuable, they have limitations, and many el\u00ad\nigible individuals remain unscreened. Although novel \nscreening techniques may help in early CRC detection and \nrisk factor modification, significant benefits can still be \nachieved by optimizing existing screening methods. Chalya \net al. highlight that CRC is rising in sub-Saharan Africa, at\u00ad\ntributed to urbanization and lifestyle changes. In contrast, \nCRC incidence is declining in developed countries due to \nimproved outcomes from early detection, widespread \nscreening of high-risk populations, and advancements in di\u00ad\nagnostic tools and treatment options.19 The authors note \nthat CRC in African populations often present at a younger \nage and at a more advanced stage, leading to poorer prog\u00ad\nnosis, as illustrated by our case. \nCRC in younger patients is often associated with inher\u00ad\nited syndromes such as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal \ncancer (Lynch syndrome), inflammatory bowel disease, fa\u00ad\nmilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and MUTYH polypo\u00ad\nsis.20 This highlights age as an important factor for identi\u00ad\nfying familial and genetic predispositions.18 Due to limited \nresources, we were unable to conduct genetic screening \non our patient, and genetic predisposition could not be as\u00ad\nsessed. Several family history criteria can suggest Lynch \nsyndrome, notably the Amsterdam II Criteria and Revised \nBethesda Guidelines. These guidelines are helpful in iden\u00ad\ntifying families likely to have Lynch syndrome. \nThese include: (i) multiple family members with col\u00ad\norectal cancer, particularly if diagnosed under age 50. (ii) \npresence of other Lynch syndrome-associated cancers in \nthe family, such as endometrial, ovarian, or gastric cancer. \n(ii) cancers occurring across multiple generations. (iii) syn\u00ad\nchronous or metachronous colorectal cancers in one in\u00ad\ndividual.11 However, the morphological features observed \nin our case\u2014such as infiltrating lymphocytes, peritumoral \nlymphocytes, the absence of dirty necrosis, and mucinous \nfeatures\u2014strongly suggest a microsatellite instability-high \n(MSI-H) etiology, likely linked to LS. We recommend clin\u00ad\nicians perform genetic testing on young CRC patients \nwhenever feasible. Colonoscopy would have been valuable \nAdvanced Mucinous Colorectal Carcinoma in a Teenager: A Case Report of a Changing Age Paradigm\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n12\nto rule out conditions like FAP and MUTYH polyposis, \nwhich typically present with multiple colonic polyps. How\u00ad\never, due to the patient\u2019s unstable condition, colonoscopy \ncould not be performed. In the index case, the teenager was \ndiagnosed with advanced colorectal mucinous adenocarci\u00ad\nnoma, aligning with findings by O. K. Ibrahim et al., who \nreported that colorectal cancers in younger populations are \nfrequently either mucin-secreting or signet-ring cell carci\u00ad\nnomas. They present at advanced stages, and are associated \nwith a poor prognosis, and this is due to the marked delay in \ndiagnosis.21 A similar case presented by Akpa et al. of mu\u00ad\ncinous colon cancer in a 11-year-old female, and they state \nthat these CRC in younger generation is poorly differenti\u00ad\nated hence more aggressive and less chemo-sensitive, sug\u00ad\ngestive there may be differences in the biological pathogen\u00ad\nesis of these tumors compared to that of adults.4 \nThere are various advances in immunotherapy, however, \nits implications to CRC patients remains uncertain as there \nare various on-going studies. Current immunotherapy ap\u00ad\nproaches for CRC including cancer vaccines such as autol\u00ad\nogous vaccine, peptide vaccine, viral vector and dendritic \ncell (DC). Other immunologic therapies in trials are on\u00ad\ncolytic virus therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy \nand immune modulators such as IDO1-inhibitors and anti-\nOX40 agonist therapy.22 \nConventional cancer treatment strategies widely used to\u00ad\nday include surgical tumor resection, often followed by \nradiotherapy with x-rays and/or chemotherapy. Surgery is \nmost effective during the early stages of disease progres\u00ad\nsion. However, radiation and chemotherapy pose risks, such \nas damage to healthy tissues and growing cells. Addition\u00ad\nally, drug resistance remains a significant challenge in \nchemotherapy treatments. Targeted drug therapy offers a \nsolution by specifically attacking cancer cells while min\u00ad\nimizing damage to normal, healthy cells. This approach \nexploits the unique programming that distinguishes cancer \ncells from healthy ones. Widely used targeted agents in\u00ad\nclude monoclonal antibodies and small molecule in\u00ad\nhibitors.23 \nA limitation of our case study is that we were unable \nto confirm a diagnosis of LS due to the unavailability of \ngermline mutation testing in our setting. Similarly, although \nimmunohistochemical testing for mismatch repair (MMR) \nproteins (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) is a reliable \nmethod for diagnosing Lynch syndrome, this was also not \nfeasible due to the patient\u2019s financial constraints. Our case \nstudy, along with similar reports of early-onset CRC, high\u00ad\nlights the need for improved CRC screening and the devel\u00ad\nopment of genetic counseling services to help prevent ad\u00ad\nvanced CRC in at-risk family members. \nCONCLUSION \nColorectal cancer (CRC) in patients under 40 years of age \nis relatively rare, with mucinous adenocarcinoma represent\u00ad\ning a particularly uncommon and aggressive subtype. This \ndemographic often experiences challenges such as late pre\u00ad\nsentation, delayed diagnosis, and a lack of definitive clin\u00ad\nical symptoms, which frequently lead to poorer outcomes. \nTo mitigate these issues, early and proactive screening is \nessential, especially for individuals with a family history of \nCRC. Physicians must maintain a high level of vigilance \nand conduct comprehensive evaluations for young patients \nexhibiting colorectal symptoms. By prioritizing early detec\u00ad\ntion and timely treatment, healthcare providers can signifi\u00ad\ncantly improve prognosis and patient outcomes. \nCRC and its management pose significant diagnostic \nand therapeutic challenges in resource-limited countries \nlike Tanzania. The late presentation of CRC and the ab\u00ad\nsence of adequate screening programs contribute to high \nmorbidity and mortality rates in these developing regions. \nTo address these issues, stakeholders should focus on im\u00ad\nproving population education, training clinicians at the pri\u00ad\nmary health level, implementing screening programs for \nhigh-risk individuals, and introducing cost-effective treat\u00ad\nment options. Additionally, enhancing follow-up tech\u00ad\nniques is crucial for better management and outcomes in \nCRC patients. \nCONSENT \nWritten informed consent was obtained from a legal au\u00ad\nthorized representative for publication for this case report; \nadditionally, accompanying images have been censored to \nensure patient confidentiality.

In low-resource settings like Uganda, managing \nthese conditions is especially difficult due to limited access to multidisciplinary specialized care. The shortage of Craniofacial \nSurgeons and inadequately equipped healthcare facilities further complicate the delivery of proper treatment. This study \npresents three cases of children with craniofacial anomalies attended at Kiruddu Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda, \nhighlighting the significant gaps in care and the pressing need for enhanced medical resources in East Africa. \nBackground \nCraniofacial Anomalies (CFAs) are among the most com\u00ad\nmon human birth defects and have considerable functional, \naesthetic, and social consequences.1,2 Each year, approxi\u00ad\nmately 295,000 infants succumb to congenital anomalies, \nwith the majority of these anomalies involving a diverse ar\u00ad\nray of structural and functional abnormalities of the head \nand facial areas.2\u20115 Clefts of the palate and lips are com\u00ad\nmonly reported form associated with CFA occurring in 1 \nout of every 700 live births.4 \nIn low-resource countries like Uganda, there is a signifi\u00ad\ncant dearth of information regarding the presentation, man\u00ad\nagement, and outcomes of children with CFAs. Compound\u00ad\ning this issue is the lack of accessible Craniofacial Surgeons \nand adequately equipped Craniofacial units, which hinders \nthe provision of appropriate care and support for these chil\u00ad\ndren.6\u20118 Moreover, studies have indicated that children with \ncraniofacial anomalies are often stigmatized, with some as\u00ad\nsociating their condition with superstitions such as divine \npunishment or witchcraft.9\u201111 \nWe report therefore, three cases of children born with \nCFA at Kiruddu National Referral Hospital. We aim to cre\u00ad\nate awareness to the public about presentation and manage\u00ad\nment challenges of children with CFA but also to inform \npolicy makers to set priorities tailored in supporting chil\u00ad\ndren with this condition in low resources countries includ\u00ad\ning Uganda. \nCase 1 \nThe case involves a 3-week-old female baby who was de\u00ad\nlivered at term with several craniofacial anomalies. The \nbaby had a complete bilateral cleft lip, an incomplete defect \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

While the right ear appears normal, the \nleft ear exhibits complete hypoplasia (microtia). \nin the left 1/3 of the lower lip, and a complete defect of the \npalate with a tag on the right nasal side wall. Additionally, \nthere were wide-set eyes, a small mandible, absence of the \nleft external ear, and a normal canal. The child experienced \ndifficulty in suckling and breathing when breast milk was \ngiven. The parents had limited education and occasional al\u00ad\ncohol intake but no reported family history of CFA or other \ncongenital malformation. \nThe child was diagnosed with Goldenhar syndrome, a \nsyndromic craniofacial anomaly, along with a differential \ndiagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome with facial clefts, \nbilateral complete cleft lip and palate, and nasal pyriform \naperture stenosis. \nDue to financial constraints and limited diagnostic tech\u00ad\nniques, sophisticated investigations have not been per\u00ad\nformed. The planned treatment involves orthodontist inter\u00ad\nvention, lip repair at the age of 3 months, cleft and Tessier \nrepair at 9-12 months, and left ear reconstruction between \nthe ages of 6 and 10 years, although the child has not yet \nreached the appropriate age for these specific operations. \nFigure1 \nCase 2 \nThe case involves a one-month-old male child who was \nborn with multiple deformities affecting the head, fingers, \nand toes. The baby was delivered via Caesarian section \npost-term, weighed 3.7kg, and required oxygen support for \nfour hours after delivery. The child is the fifth born to \na 26-year-old mother and 34-year-old father. The mother \nreceived prenatal care, including iron and folic acid sup\u00ad\nFigure 2 A & B.

The diagnosis of Apert syndrome, characterized \nby mitten or spoon fingers, a high peaked forehead, a high \narch, and hypertelorism was made. (Figure 2) \nCase 3 \nThe case involves a 6-month-old male child who presented \nwith an abnormal head shape since birth, accompanied by \nabnormal limb movements, finger fixed in a flexed po\u00ad\nsition, hearing impairment, delayed milestones, and poor \nweight gain. The child is the third born and was delivered \nby Caesarean section at term, with delayed crying and the \nneed for resuscitation. The mother received prenatal care \nstarting at 12 weeks gestational age and made six visits, re\u00ad\nceiving folic acid, Tetanus toxoid, and unidentified malaria \ntreatment. There is a family history of similar abnormalities \nin the paternal grandmother and great grandfather, with fin\u00ad\ngers fixed in flexed positions. \nThe child\u2019s parents are refugees from the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, with no history of alcohol or sub\u00ad\nstance use. The other two siblings are unaffected.

Computed tomography scans \nconfirmed metopic, coronal, and sagittal fusion, leading to \nleading to a diagnosis of metopic craniosynostosis (Carpen\u00ad\nter syndrome). The child did not undergo surgical correc\u00ad\ntion due to the unavailability of a craniofacial surgeon and \ncraniofacial unit, and there was no screening for syndromic \ncauses due to limited molecular diagnostic techniques in the \nlocal setting. (figure 3) \nDiscussion \nWe present three cases of children with craniofacial anom\u00ad\nalies (CFA) who were treated at Kiruddu National Referral \nHospital. The first case involves a child with Goldenhar \nsyndrome, the second case The first case involves a child \nwith Goldenhar syndrome, the second case is a child with \nApert syndrome, and the third case is a child with metopic \nCraniosynostosis (Carpenter syndrome). The standard ap\u00ad\nproach to describing CFA includes both physical and clin\u00ad\nical observations. However, the comprehensive evaluation \nof these patients requires sophisticated investigations such \nas CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiogram, and \nelectrocardiogram (ECG). Unfortunately, these investiga\u00ad\ntions were not initially conducted due to financial con\u00ad\nstraints and the lack of genetic typing service in our setting. \nAmong the reported cases, only the one with metopic \nCraniosynostosis (Carpenter syndrome) had a reported fam\u00ad\nily history. This is consistent with the most studies on cran\u00ad\niofacial anomalies (CFA) that occur sporadically, possibly \ndue to new mutations.5,12 As observed in our case series, \ncraniofacial anomalies (CFA) typically manifest with a \ncombination of deformities affecting the extremities, neck, \nheart, and abdomen, in line with previous research find\u00ad\nings.13 None of the three cases showed any evident risk \nfactors for CFAs, highlighting the need for further inves\u00ad\ntigation into the etiology and pathogenesis of congenital \ncraniofacial anomalies in our setting. Unfortunately, the \nlack of advanced molecular diagnostic techniques hampers \nour ability to identify and understand many craniofacial dis\u00ad\norders, leaving them unknown.1 Nevertheless, majority of \nthe congenital body defects still have no known causes es\u00ad\ntablished, most cases do occur sporadically, influenced by \ngenetic and environmental factors such as smoking, alco\u00ad\nhol use , pre and post conception folic acid use, among \nothers.14\u201116 Effective management of children with cranio\u00ad\nfacial anomalies (CFA) necessitates a comprehensive, coor\u00ad\ndinated, and culturally sensitive approach to care. However, \nour case series and similar studies have revealed a signif\u00ad\nicant lack of easily accessible specialized and coordinated \ncare to address the unique challenges faced by these chil\u00ad\ndren, particularly in low-resource countries.17 \nAlthough no obvious risk factors were identified in any \nof the three cases, the lack of improved molecular diagnos\u00ad\ntic techniques in our setting hampers our ability to further \nunderstand the causes and mechanisms underlying congen\u00ad\nital craniofacial anomalies. As a result, many craniofacial \ndisorders remain unknown and require further investigation \nfor a comprehensive understanding of their etiology and \npathogenesis. \nPresentation and Challenges Associated with Management Of Children with Craniofacial Anomalies at Kir\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n18\nConclusion \nThis case series provided valuable insights into the three \ncases of craniofacial anomalies, but it is important to note \nthat the follow-up for these cases was limited. As a result, \nthe specific details regarding the long-term management \nand outcomes of these individuals remain unclear. While \nthe initial diagnoses and treatment plans were established, \nthe comprehensive assessment of their progress and the ef\u00ad\nfectiveness of the interventions were not fully documented. \nFurther research and more extensive follow-up studies are \nnecessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the \nmanagement and outcomes for individuals with craniofacial \nanomalies in resource constraints settings. Establishing a \nsafe and effective service for craniofacial anomalies in a \nnational referral hospital requires assembling a multidis\u00ad\nciplinary team, creating dedicated facilities, and providing \ncontinuous training for healthcare professionals. This train\u00ad\ning can be facilitated through national and international ex\u00ad\nchange programs, including workshops and on-site visits by \nexperts from high-income countries. \nSubmitted: July 20, 2023 EAT, Accepted: October 01, \n2024 EAT \nPresentation and Challenges Associated with Management Of Children with Craniofacial Anomalies at Kir\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n19\nReferences \n1.

The Department of \nOrthopedic Surgery at the University of Zambia is home to FlySpec, a medical charity that facilitates surgical care delivery to \nthe most remote Zambian communities. We studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the FlySpec program. \nMethods: We analyzed yearly FlySpec reports from 2018 to 2022 to identify differences in various surgical care delivery \nmetrics. \nResults: We found that there was a reduction in the number of hospital visits, patients seen, and operations performed \nPost-COVID-19 compared to Pre-COVID-19. There was no difference in the number of FlySpec car visits or air visits in relation \nto the COVID-19 pandemic. \nConclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the clinical activity of FlySPec. \nIntroduction \nOrthopedic injuries and musculoskeletal trauma are major \ncontributors to the global burden of disease.1,2 While or\u00ad\nthopedic surgery is a vital component of healthcare in de\u00ad\nveloped countries, many low-income countries struggle to \nprovide adequate care for their populations due to limited \nresources, poor infrastructure, and a shortage of trained pro\u00ad\nfessionals.3,4 In low-income countries, musculoskeletal in\u00ad\njuries and conditions are often left untreated or are treated \ninadequately, leading to disability, chronic pain, and re\u00ad\nduced quality of life for patients.3,5 These countries also ex\u00ad\nperience a higher burden of orthopedic conditions due to \nfactors such as poor road infrastructure, limited access to \nsafe water and sanitation, and a high prevalence of infec\u00ad\ntious diseases. In Sub-Saharan African nations, healthcare \nresources are typically concentrated in dense, urban cities \nwhich makes it more challenging to provide surgical care to \nrural populations.6\u20118 \nAddressing the need for orthopedic surgery in low-in\u00ad\ncome countries requires a concerted effort from govern\u00ad\nments, healthcare professionals, and the global health com\u00ad\nmunity. Outreach programs and mission trips are important \ntools that can mobilize medical experts to provide higher \nlevels of care in rural communities. The Department of Or\u00ad\nthopedic Surgery at the University of Zambia is home to \nFlySpec, a medical charity that facilitates surgical care de\u00ad\nlivery to the most remote and rural Zambian communities.9 \nEstablished in 1982, FlySpec operates with a team of ortho\u00ad\npedic surgeons, prosthetists, physiotherapists, and one plas\u00ad\ntic surgeon. The organization travels via road and air trans\u00ad\nport to reach rural hospitals where the patient population \nlacks access to consistent surgical care.

Conducting a study to examine the \ncurrent state of the program and how it has operated over \nthe past few years will provide valuable insight into its ca\u00ad\npacity and future potential. \nMethods \nThis retrospective chart review study involving human par\u00ad\nticipants was in accordance with the ethical standards of \nthe institutional and national research committee and with \nthe 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments \nor comparable ethical standards. The National Health Re\u00ad\nsearch Authority (NHRA) of Zambia approved this study. \nWe conducted a retrospective study examining FlySpec \ntrip reports from 2018-2022. The sites included in the trip \nreports span across 7 provinces in Zambia. These were \nMukinge Mission Hospital, Chitokoloki Mission Hospital, \nand Kalene Hills Hospital in the Northwestern Province. \nThe sites in the Northern Province included Chilonga Mis\u00ad\nsion Hospital, Kasama Teaching Hospital, and Mbala Gen\u00ad\neral Hospital. The Eastern Province site was St. Francis \nMission Hospital and the Western Province site was \nLewanika General Hospital. Macha General Hospital, Maz\u00ad\nabuka General Hospital, and Livingstone Teaching Hospi\u00ad\ntal comprised the Southern Province sites. Kabwe General \nHospital in the Central Province and Mansa General Hospi\u00ad\ntal in Luapula Province were also included. All trip reports \nwere collected by one individual. \nThe trip reports include valuable information regarding \nthe logistics of clinical care. Pertinent metrics include the \nnumber of hospital visits, both by air and by car. Addi\u00ad\ntionally, the operative case volume and quantity of patients \nseen were scrutinized. These metrics were recorded using \nthe same software across all hospital visits. The reports in\u00ad\ncluded other metrics, such as \u201cmajor operations\u201d, \u201cminor \noperations\u201d, and \u201cimplants used\u201d. However, these were not \nconsistently disclosed in trip reports and showed a degree of \nprovider variability. Therefore, these metrics were left out \nof the retrospective analysis and omitted from comparison. \nMean values and standard deviations were used to analyze \ndifferences in the data. \nStatistical Analysis \nFirst, the data was classified into two groups. The first \ngroup was defined as Pre-COVID-19 and included data \nfrom the years 2018-2019. The second group was defined \nas Post-COVID-19 and included data from the years \n2020-2022. Next, the mean value of each metric in both \ngroups was calculated. Following this, the standard devia\u00ad\ntion for each metric in the Post-COVID-19 group was cal\u00ad\nculated. \nThe null hypothesis is that COVID-19 has no effect on \nFlySpec hospital visits. \nResults \nAnnual report data can be found in Table 1. The mean num\u00ad\nber of hospital visits Pre-COVID-19 was 71.5 compared \nto a Post-COVID-19 mean of 57.6. This decrease is also \nreflected in the mean number of Pre-COVID-19 air vis\u00ad\nits, which was 45, compared to a Post-COVID-19 mean \nof 30.6. On the contrary, the mean number of car visits \nincreased after 2020, with a Post-COVID-19 mean of 27 \ncompared to a Pre-COVID-19 mean of 26.5. These differ\u00ad\nences highlight the changes in FlySpec practice following \nCOVID-19. \nSimilarly, the mean number of patients seen and number \nof operations performed decreased in Post-COVID-19 com\u00ad\npared to Pre-COVID-19 (Figure 1). The standard deviation \n(std dev) for the Post-COVID-19 metrics was also calcu\u00ad\nlated (Table 2). Finally, the mean value difference between \nPre-COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 metrics was calculated \nto compare average changes. This comparison is shown in \nTable 3. \nDiscussion \nOur results highlight a difference in the number of hospital \nvisits, patients seen, and operations performed between Pre-\nCOVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 values. On the other hand, \na smaller difference was observed in both the number of air \nvisits and car visits throughout COVID-19. This is likely \nUnderstanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Zambia\u2019s FlySpec Program in Delivering Specialized Surgical Ca\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n22\nbecause the determining factor between a car visit or an air \nvisit taking place is the distance of the rural hospital from \nLusaka, Zambia. The COVID-19 pandemic had no effect \non this distance. Therefore, despite its effects on resource \nmobilization and healthcare personnel, COVID-19 failed to \nhave a large impact on affecting FlySpec\u2019s mode of trans\u00ad\nportation to a rural hospital. \nThe reduction in FlySpec\u2019s clinical activity after 2020 is \nconsistent with published findings that COVID-19 has dis\u00ad\nrupted clinical services globally.13,14 Elective surgeries and \ninternational humanitarian efforts were severely impacted \nby the pandemic, and FlySpec\u2019s efforts were similarly at\u00ad\ntenuated.15,16 Patients residing in remote Zambian com\u00ad\nmunities are most likely to be affected by this decrease in \nFlySpec\u2019s activity. This has likely resulted in further pro\u00ad\ngression of their pathologies resultinging in more urgent \nclinical presentations. As FlySpec\u2019s clinical activity \nreaches pre-COVID-19 levels, there may be a correspond\u00ad\ning shift in patient morbidity as a result of this delayed pre\u00ad\nsentation. Future studies are needed to accurately assess this \ndiscrepancy and to expand on this study\u2019s findings. For in\u00ad\nstance, analyzing intraoperative data will result in a better \nassessment of FlySpec\u2019s surgical capacity. \nLimitations \nThis study has several limitations. The FlySpec trip data \nis reported as annual aggregates as opposed to individual \ntrip details. This is because FlySpec aggregates numerous \ntrip reports and reports them in annual newsletters as op\u00ad\nposed to individual trip reports. Efforts to obtain individual \ntrip reports were not successful. This data aggregation has \nFigure 1. Mean data of FlySpec reports Pre-COVID-19 vs Post-COVD-19 \nTable 2.

Notwithstanding this, valuable points can be \nlearned from this article regarding the detrimental impact of \nCOVID-19 on FlySpec\u2019s outreach efforts. \nConclusion \nFlySpec, a medical charity based in Zambia, has developed \npartnerships with rural hospitals over the past several \ndecades. The organization has been heavily impacted by the \nUnderstanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Zambia\u2019s FlySpec Program in Delivering Specialized Surgical Ca\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n23\nCOVID-19 pandemic.

In Malawi, \nosteosarcoma accounts for 2.2% of all registered bone tumors. However, little is known about the patterns of diagnosis and \ntreatment of this disease in this setting. Delays in diagnosis and treatment may contribute to poor outcomes and survival. \nTherefore, this study aimed to describe the clinical features, diagnostic methods, and treatment modalities associated with \nosteosarcoma in Malawi. The study also investigated timelines between symptom onset, healthcare consultation, diagnosis, \ntreatment, and outcomes. \nMethod \nWe conducted a retrospective review of medical records of 25 patients who were diagnosed with osteosarcoma at Queen \nElizabeth Tertiary Hospital, in Blantyre- Malawi, between January 2011 and December 2016. We extracted data on patient \ndemographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic procedures, incisional biopsy histological findings, treatment options, and \ntime intervals from symptom onset to first presentation at a tertiary hospital, and from diagnosis to treatment initiation. We \nobtained approval, to conduct study, from the College of Medicine Research and Ethics Center (COMREC) (P.02/18/2364). \nResults \nOut of 11,165 malignancies registered during the study period, 25 (0.22%) were osteosarcoma cases. The median age of the \npatients was 25.04 years (SD +/-11) with an equal sex distribution. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (100%) \nand swelling (92%). The median duration from symptom onset to first visit at tertiary hospital being 8.5 months and time of \ndiagnosis to treatment with a median duration of 16.5 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by histology in 14 (56%) cases and \nby radiography in 11 (44%) cases. No tumor grade was recorded in the histology reports. The treatment carried out included \namputation (48%), palliative care (symptom supportive care) (32%), limb salvage surgery (4%), and neoadjuvant chemotherapy \n(4%). Three patients (12%) refused amputation. No patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. \nConclusion \nOsteosarcoma is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat in Malawi due to its rarity, nonspecific symptoms, lack of \nhistological grading and staging, limited treatment options, and long delays in the care pathway. There is a need for increased \nawareness and suspicion among primary health care providers, improved access to diagnostic facilities and specialized care, \nand multidisciplinary collaboration to optimize the management and prognosis of osteosarcoma patients in this setting. \nBackground \nOsteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumour that originates \nfrom primitive bone-forming mesenchymal cells.1 It is the \nmost common primary bone cancer in children, adoles\u00ad\ncents, and young adults, with a peak incidence in the second \ndecade of life.1,2 It has a male predominance and usually \naffects the metaphyseal regions of long bones, especially \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

In sub-Saharan Africa, \nosteosarcoma poses a significant challenge for the health \nsystem, as it requires specialized care and multidisciplinary \nmanagement.11,12 The epidemiology of osteosarcoma in \nthis region is poorly understood, as there is a lack of reliable \ndata from population-based cancer registries. \nAccording to the Global Burden of Disease report, os\u00ad\nteosarcoma was responsible for 0.1% of all cancer deaths \nand 0.2% of all cancer disability-adjusted life years \n(DALYs) in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019.13 However, these \nestimates may not reflect the true burden of the disease, as \nthey are based on modelling and extrapolation from other \nregions. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more re\u00ad\nsearch and investment in data production, analysis, and in\u00ad\nterpretation to inform national cancer policies and programs \nin sub-Saharan Africa. \nOne of the factors that contributes to the poor outcomes \nof osteosarcoma patients in sub-Saharan Africa is the late \npresentation of the disease.14,15 Muthupei and Mariba re\u00ad\nported a 5-year survival rate of 7.5% in their 2000 study \nof 66 osteosarcoma patients at a tertiary hospital in South \nAfrica (SA), which is comparable to outcomes from the \n1950s in developed countries.14 In 2010, Shipley and \nBeukes reported on 30 patients with osteosarcoma treated \nat another SA tertiary institution.16 Half of their patients \npresented with metastases.5,16 The majority of patients in \nthese studies from developing countries presented with ad\u00ad\nvanced disease, to which the authors attributed their poor \noutcomes compared with the far better survival rates in de\u00ad\nveloped countries .5,16 Marko et al observed that patients \nin countries with medium/low Human Development Index \nhad longer delays and higher prevalence of metastasis at di\u00ad\nagnosis compared to those in countries with very high/high \nHuman Development Index.17 Noor et al. had similar find\u00ad\nings in a study in Cambodia, with a 5-year survival rate of \nonly 8%, citing late presentation and cultural preferences as \nthe main factors responsible for the poor outcomes.5,18 In \nsummary, the factors contributing to diagnostic delay may \nbe related to the patient (lack of knowledge around bone \ntumours, limited finances to travel to a health care facil\u00ad\nity,lack of finances to pay for diagnostic tests), the provider \n(limited diagnostic capacity, unavailability of in house spe\u00ad\ncialists), or the country (no well-established referral sys\u00ad\ntems, failure to supply stocks or service diagnostic tools e.g. \nmagnetic resonance imaging).5,19 \nThese studies highlight the need for early detection and \nreferral of osteosarcoma cases, as well as improved access \nto quality care and supportive services for patients and their \nfamilies. \nThe treatment of osteosarcoma has improved signifi\u00ad\ncantly in the last 25 years, especially for patients with local\u00ad\nized disease.1,2,7,14 This is attributed to the advancement in \nmultimodal therapy that combines surgery and chemother\u00ad\napy.3,5,15,20 Several randomized trials have shown that the \ncombination of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy \nwith surgery significantly improves the cure rates and re\u00ad\nduces the local and distant relapse rates.21 The surgical op\u00ad\ntions include limb salvage or amputation depending on the \ntumor location, size, extent, and response to chemother\u00ad\napy.7 The goal of surgery is to achieve adequate local con\u00ad\ntrol and preserve function.7 \nTherefore, this study aimed to describe the clinical fea\u00ad\ntures, diagnostic methods, and treatment modalities asso\u00ad\nciated with osteosarcoma in Malawi. The study also in\u00ad\nvestigated timelines between symptom onset, healthcare \nconsultation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. To our \nknowledge, this is the first study to address this topic in this \nsetting. \nMethods \nWe conducted a retrospective review of medical records \nof 25 patients who were diagnosed with osteosarcoma at \nQueen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital between January 2011 \nand December 2016. Queen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital is \nthe largest referral center for oncology patients in Malawi. \nWe obtained an approval to carry out the study from the \nCollege of Medicine Research and Ethics Center (COM\u00ad\nREC) (P.02/18/2364. Formal request was written to head of \ndepartment in Oncology Unit, Surgery Department and hos\u00ad\npital director to have access to patients\u2019 charts. No informed \nconsent was obtained from the patients since the study did \nnot involve intervention on patients or contacting the pa\u00ad\ntients. \nWe included all inpatients who had been diagnosed with \nosteosarcoma during this period based on histological or ra\u00ad\ndiological criteria. We excluded patients who had insuffi\u00ad\ncient data or whose diagnosis changed to another malig\u00ad\nOsteosarcoma diagnosis and treatment at a tertiary hospital in Blantyre, Malawi: A retrospective, descripti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n26\nChart 1. Paper screening and inclusion \nnancy after review of histology. Refer to chart 1 delineating \ninclusion criteria. \nWe collected data on patient demographics, presenting \nsymptoms, diagnostic procedures, histological findings, \ntreatment options, and time intervals from symptom onset \nto treatment initiation using a data collection sheet. \nWe defined symptom onset as the date when the patient \nfirst noticed any symptom related to osteosarcoma; presen\u00ad\ntation as the date when the patient first visited low level \nhealth care system and from low level care to first visit \nat tertiary hospital; diagnosis as the date when histological \nor radiological confirmation was obtained; treatment as the \ndate when any therapeutic intervention was started; patient \ndelay as the time interval from symptom onset to presen\u00ad\ntation; professional delay as the time interval from presen\u00ad\ntation to diagnosis; system delay as the time interval from \ndiagnosis to treatment; and total delay as the time interval \nfrom symptom onset to treatment. \nWe used Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, Red\u00ad\nmond, WA) to build our database and generate tables and \ncharts. \nWe \nused IBM SPSS Version \n1.0.0-1762 \n(1.0.0-1762) to perform descriptive statistics and frequency \nanalysis. \nRESULTS \nThe study examined the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treat\u00ad\nment of osteosarcoma cases at Queen Elizabeth Tertiary \nHospital in Malawi. \nThe main findings were: Osteosarcoma was a rare ma\u00ad\nlignancy, accounting for only 0.22% (n=25 out of 11,165) \nof all cancers registered during the study period.22 The pa\u00ad\ntients had a median age of 25.04 years (Standard Devia\u00ad\ntion (SD) =11), with an equal sex distribution (13 males and \n12 females) and a wide age range (13-58 years). The most \ncommon symptoms were pain 100%(n=25) and swelling \n92% (n=23) refer to figure 1, and the most common site \nwas the knee refer to figure 4. The common site of osteosar\u00ad\ncoma was around the knee 44% (n=11) refer to diagram 1. \nThe diagnosis was confirmed by histology in 56%(n=14) \nof cases and by radiography in 44% (n=11) of cases. 76% \n(n=19) had incisional biopsy done but only 56%(n=14) re\u00ad\nceived histology results. No tumor grade was recorded in \nany histology report. Except for 16%(n=4) cases that pre\u00ad\nsented with metastasis, which is stage 3 on Enneking clas\u00ad\nsification, the rest could not be assigned an Enneking stage. \nThe median duration from symptom onset to presentation \nat the tertiary hospital was 8.5 months, indicating a long \ndelay in seeking care. The mean time from diagnosis to \ntreatment was 16.4 days. The treatment offered (figure 2 \nand 3) included amputation in 48% (n=12) of cases, symp\u00ad\ntomatic palliative care in 32%(n=8), limb salvage surgery \nfor 4% (n=1) of the cases, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy \nonly 4% (n=1). No patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. \n12% (n=3) of our patients declined to have an amputation. \nThe study did not report on the survival or outcome of \nthe patients due to lack of digitized data for outpatient care \nor cancer registry that actively followed up patients in out\u00ad\npatient setting. This resulted in the loss of the information \nto determine survival or outcome of the chosen treatments. \nTable 1, summarizes the demographic, clinical, diagnos\u00ad\ntic, and treatment characteristics of the study population. \nOsteosarcoma diagnosis and treatment at a tertiary hospital in Blantyre, Malawi: A retrospective, descripti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n27\nFigure 1.

Graph showing surgeries done or offered \nDISCUSSION \nOsteosarcoma is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat \nin Malawi due to its rarity, nonspecific symptoms, lack of \nhistological grading and staging, limited treatment options \n, and long delays in the care pathway . Our study provides \nsome insights into these issues based on a retrospective \nreview of medical records of 25 osteosarcoma patients at \nQueen Elizabeth Tertiary Hospital. \nOur study population had a median age of 26 years , \nwhich is higher than the peak incidence age reported in \nother studies .1,3,4 This may reflect a different epidemiol\u00ad\nogy of osteosarcoma in Malawi or a selection bias due to \nlate presentation or referral. We also found an equal sex dis\u00ad\ntribution among our patients , whereas other studies have \nreported a male predominance .23\u201125 These findings suggest \nthat there may be some demographic differences between \nosteosarcoma patients in Malawi and those in other settings, \nbut sample size was small to make definitive conclusion. \nThe most common presenting symptoms in our study \nwere pain and swelling , which are consistent with previous \nreports .7,9,26,27 However ,the median duration of symptom \nonset to presentation at tertiary hospital for osteosarcoma \npatients in Malawi was 8.5 months, which is much longer \nthan what has been reported elsewhere.2,8,23,26,28 For ex\u00ad\nample, a study from Ethiopia reported a median duration \nof 3.5 months for bone sarcoma patients,8 while a study \nfrom Nigeria reported a mean duration of 36 months+/-4.1 \nmonths for osteosarcoma patients,27 Tanzania sarcoma \nstudy by Siwillis et al.28 had reported duration of 5 months.\nIn contrast, studies from developed countries have reported \nmuch shorter durations, such as 1.2 months in the UK,21.3 \nmonths in the USA,23 and 1.5 months in Canada.26 These \ndifferences may reflect the variations in the availability \nand accessibility of health care services, the awareness and \nknowledge of osteosarcoma symptoms, and the socio-eco\u00ad\nnomic and cultural factors that influence health-seeking be\u00ad\nhavior among osteosarcoma patients in different settings. \nUnfortunately, we could not obtain data on symptom on\u00ad\nset to first visit at any health center because it was not doc\u00ad\numented in the files, which would have helped us to better \nunderstand this aspect. \nThe confirmation of osteosarcoma diagnosis by histol\u00ad\nogy in only 56% of the cases in Malawi is lower than the \nrates reported in other African countries, such as Ethiopia \n(86.4%), Tanzania (100%), and South Africa (100%).8,9,28 \nThis suggests that there is a need to improve the availability \nand accessibility of biopsy services and histopathology lab\u00ad\noratories in Malawi.The lack of tumor grade or staging in \nthe Malawian study is also a major limitation, as these fac\u00ad\ntors are important for prognostication and treatment plan\u00ad\nning. In contrast, other studies from Africa and elsewhere \nhave reported the tumor grade and stage of osteosarcoma \npatients. The absence of standardized reporting or quality \ncontrol for osteosarcoma diagnosis in Malawi may affect \nthe accuracy and outcomes of these patients. The use of ra\u00ad\ndiography as the sole diagnostic method in 44% (n=11) of \nthe cases in our study is not recommended, as radiography \nalone cannot differentiate between benign and malignant \nbone lesions. Moreover, radiography cannot provide infor\u00ad\nmation on the histological subtype, and grade of osteosar\u00ad\ncoma, which are essential for determining the appropriate \ntreatment regimen. Therefore, radiography should be used \nOsteosarcoma diagnosis and treatment at a tertiary hospital in Blantyre, Malawi: A retrospective, descripti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n28\nas an adjunct to biopsy and histopathology, not as a substi\u00ad\ntute. \nThe common site of osteosarcoma was around the knee \n44% (n=11) refer to diagrammatic presentation. This is in \nkeeping with studies done in other centres.1,2,28 \nThe mean time from diagnosis to treatment was 16.4 \ndays in our study , which is comparable to what has been \nreported in other low- and middle-income countries.15,19,\n29However , we found that only 4% (n=1) of our patients re\u00ad\nceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy , which is considered as \nan essential component of multimodal therapy for osteosar\u00ad\ncoma .4,19,21This was likely be due to lack of resources \n, expertise , protocols , or compliance for administering \nchemotherapy in Malawi,during the period data was col\u00ad\nlected. Furthermore, we found that only 4% (n=1) of our pa\u00ad\ntients underwent limb salvage surgery, whereas 48%(n=12) \nunderwent amputation. This may be due to lack of facilities, \nequipment, skills, or prosthesis for performing limb salvage \nsurgery in Malawi. Limb salvage surgery has been shown \nto improve function and quality of life without compromis\u00ad\ning survival compared to amputation.16,30 \nHowever, some patients may refuse limb salvage \nsurgery due to fear of recurrence or preference for amputa\u00ad\ntion. We found that 12%(n=3) of our patients declined am\u00ad\nputation, which may be due to cultural or religious reasons, \nlack of social support, or poor understanding of the disease \nand its treatment. \nThe comparison of survival rates between our study and \nother studies is difficult, as the QECH study did not report \nthe follow-up duration or the number of deaths among the \npatients. However, based on the available data, it can be \ninferred that the survival rate of osteosarcoma patients in \nFigure 4. Diagram showing geographical distribution of Osteosarcoma \nMalawi is likely to be low, as 52% (n=13) of them pre\u00ad\nsented with advanced disease (16%(n=4) with metastasis \nto lung and liver and 36%(n=9) with unspecified advanced \ndisease at diagnosis), which is associated with poor prog\u00ad\nnosis.16,28,31 In addition, most of them did not receive ad\u00ad\nequate treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or \nsurgery, due to various reasons, such as late referral, or \nrefusal. These factors may also contribute to the low sur\u00ad\nvival rate of osteosarcoma patients in Malawi. In com\u00ad\nparison, other studies from Africa and elsewhere have re\u00ad\nported higher survival rates for osteosarcoma patients who \nreceived multimodal treatment, such as chemotherapy, \nsurgery, and radiotherapy.16,19,30 \nOur study has some limitations that should be acknowl\u00ad\nedged. First, it was a retrospective study based on medical \nrecords that may have been incomplete or inaccurate. Sec\u00ad\nond, it was conducted at a single tertiary hospital that may \nnot be representative of the whole country. Third, it had \na small sample size that may limit the generalizability. \nFourth, it did not include data on survival or recurrence \nrates, which are important indicators of prognosis and qual\u00ad\nity of care. \nDespite these limitations, our study provides some valu\u00ad\nable information on the clinical features, diagnostic meth\u00ad\nods, treatment modalities, and time intervals of osteosar\u00ad\ncoma patients in Malawi. It also highlights the challenges \nand gaps in the diagnosis and management of this disease \nin this setting. There is a need for increased awareness \nand suspicion among primary health care providers, im\u00ad\nproved access to diagnostic facilities and specialized care, \nand multidisciplinary collaboration to optimize the manage\u00ad\nment and prognosis of osteosarcoma patients in Malawi. \nOsteosarcoma diagnosis and treatment at a tertiary hospital in Blantyre, Malawi: A retrospective, descripti\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n29\nTable 1.

Co-existence of coronary disease among patients with rheumatic valve \ndisease is not well studied before. \nObjective \nTo evaluate the prevalence of Coronary artery disease among older adults (above 40 years of age) undergoing valve \nprocedures due to rheumatic heart disease and asses the validity of age-based recommendation for preop screening among \nthose patients. \nMethod \nRetrospective chart review of patients with rheumatic valve disease who underwent valve surgeries between January 2017 to \nOctober 2023 at Tenwek Hospital,Kenya was done. All patients 40 years of age and above were included, patients with non \nrheumatic valvular diseases, patients with confirmed or symptomatic Coronary artery disease were excluded. \nResults \nA total of 108 patients were identified. Seventy-five (69%) patients were female, median age was 51 yrs and mitral valve \nreplacement was the most common procedure. Ninety-eight percent had preop coronary screening study and only 2 cases of \nmild disease detected with the rest of them having no evidence of coronary disease. \nConclusions \nThis study showed that coronary artery disease is infrequent among patients with rheumatic valve disease and screening \ncan possibly be considered only for patients with strong risk factors rather than age alone. Further study on the topic is \nrecommended to establish strong practice guideline for this particular patient population. \nIntroduction \nChronic rheumatic valvular heart disease is the leading \ncause of cardiovascular death in developing countries. In \n2015, it was estimated to affect more than 30 million pop\u00ad\nulation in those countries, and it is the main indication \nof open-heart surgical procedures.1,2 In contrast, coronary \nartery disease is the main cardiovascular pathology and in\u00ad\ndication for cardiac surgical operations in developed na\u00ad\ntions. The valvular diseases in those countries are mainly \nrelated to age-related degenerative processes and they tend \nto have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) justify\u00ad\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(3):33-37. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i3.7\ning the recommendation for routine screening among those \npatients preoperatively. Some centers reported that the ma\u00ad\njority of patients who had aortic or mitral valve surgery \nneeded concomitant coronary procedures due to significant \ncoronary obstruction.3 \nAmong patients presenting with symptomatic aortic \nstenosis, concurrent CAD occurs in over 50 % of those \nover 70 years of age and over 65 % of those over 80 \nyears of age.4Contrary to that, due to the difference in \nthe pathophysiology of rheumatic valvular heart disease \nand socioeconomic factors, CAD is rare among the patient \npopulation. But because of the lack of strong study on \nthis issue, we have been following the AHA recommenda\u00ad\ntion of screening all patients above 40 years of age with \nChronic rheumatic valvular heart disease (CRVHD) requir\u00ad\ning surgery for incidental CAD preoperatively, although \nthe guideline recommends even lower age at 35 years for \nscreening cutoff age if patients have strong risk factors.5 \nFor this reason, we decided to evaluate the results of coro\u00ad\nnary studies among those patients who had surgery at our \nhospital from January 2017 to October 2023. \nMethods \nStudy design \nThis is a retrospective study done by reviewing the patients\u2019 \nadmission and operative charts looking for the reports of \ncoronary studies, the valve(s) affected, and procedures per\u00ad\nformed from January 2017 to October 2023 at Tenwek Hos\u00ad\npital, a training mission hospital performing the majority \nof open-heart surgery in Kenya and East African region. \nEthics approval was obtained from the hospital\u2019s institu\u00ad\ntional ethics and research committee. \nInclusion criteria-Patients aged 40 years and above, \nwith rheumatic valve disease. \nExclusion criteria: Age less than 40, all other causes \nof valvular diseases, including aortic aneurysm, degenera\u00ad\ntive disease, and symptomatic IHD patients with concomi\u00ad\ntant valve disease. \nData collection and analysis \nThe operative database was first screened and identified all \npatients who are 40 years of age or above and had open \nheart surgery due to CRVHD only, all other indications \nare excluded. The age at the time of surgery, gender, Body \nmass index (BMI), and comorbid diseases like Hyperten\u00ad\nsion (HTN) and Diabetes mellitus (DM) were recorded. The \nvalve lesions and the specific procedure (repair vs replace\u00ad\nment) were documented. The coronary study results were \nchecked and grouped as normal and abnormal. Basic de\u00ad\nscriptive statistics were done using PSPP and tables and \ngraphs were generated using MS Excel. \nResults \nOur study captured 108 patients who met the inclusion cri\u00ad\nteria during the study period. The majority (n=75) were fe\u00ad\nmale and the mean age at surgery was 51yrs as indicated in \nTable 1. \nIsolated Mitral valve replacement was the most per\u00ad\nformed single valve operation (n=37) followed by Mitral \nreplacement with Tricuspid ring annuloplasty(n=22). Com\u00ad\nbined Double or triple valve procedure accounts for almost \nhalf of the procedures(n=50) as shown in Figure 1. \nNinety-eight percent of patients had coronary studies ei\u00ad\nther with CT coronary angiography (CTCA) or invasive \ncoronary angiogram and results were reported for degree of \ncalcification with calcium score and/or degree of stenosis \nof major coronary arteries. Only two patients had mild non-\nobstructing CAD identified and required no additional in\u00ad\ntervention (figure 2). The first patient was a female, 49 \nyears old with hypercholesterolemia found in laboratory \nstudies. The second patient was also female, 60 years of age \nwith dyslipidemia and a BMI of 31kg/m2. \nAmong those patients, 17.4% of them had HTN, 3.6% \nwere diabetic and 3.6% were known to have deranged lipid \nprofiles in laboratory studies (figure 3). The prevalence of \nobesity or overweight was low among those patients and \n>50%of them had a normal BMI between 18.5 to 24.9 \nkg/m2 as seen in Table 2. \nDiscussion \nValvular heart diseases often coincide with coronary artery \ndisease (CAD) in older patients in Western countries, with \nvarying prevalence rates across studies. For instance, Em\u00ad\nren et al found significant CAD in 26.4% of Mitral stenosis \npatients and 57.7% of Aortic stenosis patients.6 Similar \nstudies reported a high prevalence of CAD in Aortic disease \n(21.4%) and mitral valve disease (16.2%).7 Patients with \naortic stenosis are more likely to have concomitant dis\u00ad\nease.8This association is attributed to the pathophysiology \nof valvular diseases, leading to degenerative calcification \nthat also affects coronary arteries. The prevalence of CAD \nis influenced by conventional risk factors such as hyperten\u00ad\nsion, male gender, dyslipidemia, smoking, and the type of \nvalve lesion.7 \nIn contrast, rheumatic valve disease, a consequence of \nacute rheumatic fever\u2019s abnormal immune reaction to strep\u00ad\ntococcal pharyngitis, has less impact on coronary vessels. \nDespite being the leading cause of cardiovascular deaths \nin children and young adults in low-middle-income coun\u00ad\ntries, rheumatic valvular heart disease typically progresses \nto heart failure without significantly affecting coronary ar\u00ad\nteries.9 \nUnlike age-related degenerative heart diseases, which \ninvolve calcification of heart valves and a high prevalence \nof concomitant coronary artery disease, patients with iso\u00ad\nThe practice and results of age-based coronary study among patients 40 years and above undergoing valve \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n34\nTable 1.

For ex\u00ad\nample, a study by Boudoulas et al reported that the majority \nof patients who had mitral or aortic valve procedures un\u00ad\nderwent CABG at the same time at Ohio State University \nMedical Center between 2002 and 2008.3 \nWhile current ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines recom\u00ad\nmend coronary evaluation for valve surgery patients12,13 \nOur study questions the applicability of these guidelines to \nrheumatic heart disease populations, where the prevalence \nof concomitant CAD and valve lesions is lower. Our find\u00ad\nings suggest that for isolated rheumatic valvular heart dis\u00ad\nease, routine CAD screening can be safely avoided for pa\u00ad\ntients with minimal or no risk factors, minimizing financial \nburdens and avoiding surgery delays. \nConclusions \nIn conclusion, our study sheds light on the nuanced rela\u00ad\ntionship between rheumatic valvular heart disease and con\u00ad\ncomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) in older patients. \nThe findings underscore the rarity of significant CAD \namong those with purely isolated rheumatic valvular heart \ndisease. Our study adds valuable insights, suggesting that \nroutine screening for CAD in patients with isolated \nrheumatic valvular heart disease may not be necessary for \nmost individuals without significant risk factors. This not \nonly avoids unnecessary financial burdens on patients but \nalso mitigates the risk of delayed surgeries that could be po\u00ad\ntentially lifesaving. \nLimitations \nIt is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of our study. \nBeing retrospective, it is susceptible to observational bi\u00ad\nases, and the absence of some essential data, such as lipid \nprofiles in certain cases, may impact the completeness of \nour findings. Additionally, the challenge of patients seeking \ncoronary studies at different hospitals and not returning \nwith the results introduces an element of uncertainty. \nRecommendations \nWe recommend future prospective studies with a larger and \nmore diverse sample to further elucidate these associations \nand contribute to refining clinical guidelines for this spe\u00ad\ncific patient population. \nList of Abbreviations \nACC/AHA- American college of cardiology/Ameri\u00ad\ncan heart association \nBMI-Body mass index \nCAD-coronary artery disease \nCRVHD-Chronic rheumatic valvular heart disease \nCTCA-CT coronary angiography \nDM-Diabetes mellitus \nESC-European society of cardiology \nCompeting interests \nWe declare there are no conflicts of interest regarding this \npaper\u2019s publication. \nSubmitted: July 23, 2024 EAT, Accepted: September 13, \n2024 EAT \nThe practice and results of age-based coronary study among patients 40 years and above undergoing valve \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n36\nReferences \n1.

Uroflowmetry is an inexpensive, simple, and non-invasive \nfollow-up urodynamic test that can evaluate the bladder and urethra\u2019s functionality post-valve ablation. This study sought \nto establish uroflowmetry as a valuable tool for patient follow-up by describing its patterns post-valve ablation at Kenyatta \nNational Hospital. \nMethods \nA cross-sectional study was conducted on participants who underwent valve ablation from January 2014 to December 2020 \nat Kenyatta National Hospital and had completed toilet training. The uroflowmetry test was conducted according to the \nInternational Children\u2019s Continence Society standards for uroflowmetry. Data on demographics, voided volume, Q max, \nflow curve pattern, and post-void residual urine were analyzed with SPSS Version 26.0. Continuous data were presented as \nmeans and medians, while categorical data were shown as frequencies and percentages. Relationships and differences were \nexplored using chi-square and paired sample t-tests. \nResults \nOut of 59 patients, 24 completed the uroflowmetry test, with a mean age of 6.6 years. There was a significant difference \nbetween the mean voided volume (139.08 mL (SD = 90.028) and mean expected bladder capacity (257.08 mL (SD = 98.576) (p \n< 0.001) post valve ablation, but no significant difference between observed (11.72 mL/s) and expected Q max (11.26 mL/s) (p \n= .596). Significant post-void residual was observed in 19 boys (79%). \nConclusions \nIncorporation of uroflowmetry as a routine follow-up metric in LMIC protocols is valuable as it can provide useful adjuncts in \ndetecting bladder dysfunction after valve ablation. \nINTRODUCTION \nIn newborn males, posterior urethral valves (PUV) are the \nmost common cause of lower urinary tract obstruction \n(LUTO), affecting 1 in every 5000 to 8000 live births, \nand accounting for roughly 60% of all LUTO cases.1 Cys\u00ad\ntoscopy and valve ablation via a transurethral incision \n(TUI), preferably within the first 4 to 16 weeks of life, is \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

Comprehensive urodynamics emerged \nas the sole modality capable of giving accurate and objec\u00ad\ntive insights into detrusor function and can be done repet\u00ad\nitively \nto \ngauge \npost-intervention \nimprovements.1 \nUroflowmetry, the non-invasive component of UDS, is a \nsimple, cost-effective modality for assessing bladder and \nurethral function that is widely used as a standalone exam\u00ad\nination to assess a child\u2019s ability to empty the bladder and \ncan, therefore, be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PUV \nablation.3 Specifically, it can detect increased bladder out\u00ad\nlet resistance by providing objective and quantitative data \non free urinary flow rate throughout the micturition process \nby measuring the Qmax, voided volume (VV), flow pattern, \nand post-void residual volume (PVR).3 \nHowever, there is a paucity of data on the use of \nuroflowmetry as a follow-up study in paediatric patients \nafter valve ablation in the African context, even though \nit is commonly advised as a first line in the assessment \nof LUTD.4 This study, therefore, aimed to establish \nuroflowmetry as a valuable and cost-effective technique for \npatient follow-up after valve ablation in a major referral \nhospital in Kenya by characterizing its patterns. Based on \nthe findings, this study would help identify uroflowmetry \nas a tool for the early detection of LUTD, such as bladder \ndysfunction, a modifiable risk factor for renal damage, con\u00ad\ntribute to the pool of local data on the incidence of LUTD \nafter valve ablation, and aid in the development of local \nguidelines and protocols for the management and follow-up \nof such patients. \nMETHODS \nStudy Design and Setting \nThis was a cross-sectional hospital-based study conducted \nat Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), the National Referral \nHospital located in Nairobi, Kenya. The hospital is \nequipped with both infrastructure and personnel that rou\u00ad\ntinely manage PUV in children. The protocol for valve ab\u00ad\nlation in KNH is through a transurethral approach via a 9 \nFr resectoscope on a cold knife. Valve ablation is done at \n12, 5, and 7 o\u2019clock positions. A Crede maneuver is subse\u00ad\nquently performed to assess the adequacy of ablation, with \na reassuring on-table stream considered adequate. \nStudy Population \nAs uroflowmetry is not routinely done as a follow-up test, \nthe study recruited participants by recalling all patients who \nunderwent PUV ablation at KNH between January 2014 \nand December 2020 and were currently on active follow-up \nin the unit\u2019s outpatient clinic. Patients who had not com\u00ad\npleted toilet training were excluded. \nData collection \nPrimary data collection adhered to the \u201cInternational Chil\u00ad\ndren\u2019s Continence Society (ICCS) Standardization Report \non Urodynamic Studies of the Lower Urinary Tract in Chil\u00ad\ndren.5\u201d Demographic information, current urological symp\u00ad\ntoms, and medical history were recorded. Uroflowmetry \nwas conducted in a dedicated Urology Centre near KNH \nwith a digital automatic GRAVIMETRIC (Weight Type) \nUroflowmeter (FLOW COMP \u00ae, model 106). Two uroflow \nmeasurements were performed for each patient to ensure \naccuracy, avoiding morning uroflows to prevent atypical \nvoiding volumes. Data collected included VV, Qmax, flow \ncurve pattern, and PVR.5 Pre-void and post-void bladder \nvolumes were estimated using sonographic evaluation, with \na significant PVR defined as more than 20% of the pre-\nvoid urine volume. A single trained staff member who rou\u00ad\ntinely performed uroflowmetry tests at the Urology Centre \nperformed all the tests to maintain consistency. Expected \nQmax values were calculated as the square root of esti\u00ad\nmated bladder capacity (EBC) for age.5 EBC (ml) was cal\u00ad\nculated by (age in years + 2) \u00d7 30 as the children were older \nthan 2 years.6 \nData Management and Analysis \nData accuracy was verified, imported into Microsoft Excel \nfor cleaning, and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for \nWindows, Version 26.0. Categorical data were presented \nas frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables \nwere analysed using means with standard deviation or me\u00ad\ndians with interquartile ranges. Relationships and differ\u00ad\nences within the dataset were explored using one-sample \nchi-square tests and paired sample t-tests.

Written \ninformed consent was obtained from all parents or \nguardians. \nRESULTS \nThe data of this study consisted of 24 patients who under\u00ad\nwent ablation of PUV at KNH between January 2014 and \nDecember 2020. The following flowchart (Figure 1) illus\u00ad\ntrates patient selection and factors contributing to the com\u00ad\npletion or non-completion of the uroflowmetry test among \n59 eligible patients. \nSample Characteristics \nTable 1 shows a summary of the demographic and clinical \ncharacteristics of the patients making up the sample. The \nmean age of the patients was 6.6 years (SD = 3.46). The \nmean age at diagnosis was 55.54 months (SD = 55.345, \nrange = 1-224). The mean age at valve ablation was 57.42 \nmonths (SD = 54.810, range = 1-224), and the time gap be\u00ad\ntween valve ablation and uroflowmetry was 38.04 months \n(SD = 14.97, range = 19-78) \nDespite valve ablation, the boys experienced a range of \nLUTS, with terminal dribbling (25%) being the most com\u00ad\nmon voiding symptom, frequency (29.2%) the most fre\u00ad\nquent storage symptom, and incomplete emptying (25%) \nthe predominant post-micturition symptom (Table 2). \nUroflowmetry parameters \nVoided Volume and Q max \nThe mean voided volume was 139.08 mL (SD = 90.028). \nThe mean EBC was 257.08 mL (SD = 98.576). The mean \nexpected Q max was 11.26 mL/s (SD = 3.59), while the \nmean observed Q max was 11.74 mL/s (SD = 5.24), as \nshown in Table 3. \nA paired-sample t-test was conducted to compare the \nmean VV and the mean EBC in millilitres (mL) in paedi\u00ad\natric patients following the ablation of PUV. The results \nshowed a significant difference between the mean VV (M = \n139.08, SD = 90.03) and the mean EBC (ml) (M = 257.08, \nSD = 98.58); t (23) = -11.34, p < 0.001, 95% CI [-139.52, \n-96.48] with the mean VV being significantly lower than \nthe mean EBC as shown in Table 4. \nA paired-sample t-test was also conducted to compare \nthe mean observed and expected Q max following valve \nablation. The results showed that there was no significant \ndifference between the mean observed Q max (M = 11.74, \nSD = 5.24) and the mean expected Q max (M = 11.26, SD \n= 3.59); t (23) = -.537, p = .596, 95% CI [-2.35, 1.38] as \nshown in Table 4. \nPost Void Residual \nSonographic assessment of bladder capacity post-micturi\u00ad\ntion revealed a significant residual urine volume of more \nthan 20% of pre-void bladder urine volume in 19 partici\u00ad\npants (79%) as shown in Table 5. \nIs Uroflowmetry a Valuable Tool for Posterior Urethral Valve Ablation Follow-Up? A Single Centre Study in \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n8\nUroflow curve patterns \nThe most common flow pattern observed was the bell-\nshaped curve (58.33 %) as shown in Figure 2. \nOne sample chi-square test was then conducted to com\u00ad\npare the observed and expected frequencies of the flow pat\u00ad\ntern curves. The expected frequencies were based on the \nassumption that 50% of patients would exhibit a normal \n(bell-shaped) flow pattern, while the remaining 50% would \nbe distributed equally among the four abnormal patterns \n(12.5% each). \nThe results showed a chi-square value =2.33 and a cor\u00ad\nresponding p-value=0.675 indicating no statistically signif\u00ad\nicant differences between the observed and expected fre\u00ad\nquencies. This confirmed the null hypothesis that the \ndistribution of flow patterns did not significantly deviate \nfrom the assumed proportions. The observed frequency of \nthe bell-shaped flow pattern was 58.33%, which was not \nsignificantly higher than the expected frequency of 50%. \nThe observed frequencies of the other flow patterns also did \nnot differ significantly from their expected frequencies of \n12.5%: staccato 12.50%, plateau 4.17%, tower 8.33%, and \ninterrupted 16.67%. \nDISCUSSION \nThe mean age at presentation and PUV diagnosis in this \nstudy was 55.4 months (4.61 years), indicating a significant \ndelay in diagnosis, which is consistent with reports from \nother LMICs like Nigeria (mean age 3.95 years) and \nCameroon (median age 1.8 years).7 Common barriers to \nearly diagnosis in these settings include limited access to \nprenatal ultrasound, poverty, parental ignorance, and inad\u00ad\nequate specialist care.7 In contrast, countries like Thailand \nand Iran report earlier detection, with a median age of 4.8 \nmonths in Thailand and 67% of cases in Iran diagnosed \nwithin the first month of life, largely due to increased uti\u00ad\nlization of prenatal ultrasound.8 In our study, most patients \nunderwent valve ablation later than in other series, high\u00ad\nlighting delays in detection and referral commonly seen in \nLMICs.7,8 \nOne important factor influencing renal outcomes has \nbeen identified as the age at valve ablation.9 Early age \nat valve ablation improves renal outcomes and lowers the \nrisk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), while delayed abla\u00ad\nTable 1.

However, despite the later-than-expected time at di\u00ad\nagnoses, ablation was done promptly after diagnosis, with \na mean age of 57.42 months, demonstrating timely action \nand the availability of specialists to manage PUV. Further\u00ad\nmore, the gap between ablation and uroflowmetry of 38.04 \nmonths may have also altered bladder dynamics, with a \nlonger delay between ablation and urodynamics being as\u00ad\nsociated with a higher prevalence of bladder dysfunction.9 \nBladder dysfunction is a common irreversible comorbid\u00ad\nity in patients with PUV post-ablation, occurring in about \n55%.2 It is caused by chronic obstruction, which disrupts \nnormal bladder cycling and causes bladder wall modifi\u00ad\ncations such as muscle hypertrophy and fibrotic remod\u00ad\nelling, eventually leading to an unyielding bladder with \nelevated resting pressure and decreased bladder capacity. \nUltimately, \nthe \nbladder \nhostility \nworsens \nhy\u00ad\ndroureteronephrosis, and gradually, renal failure devel\u00ad\nops.13\u201117 \nOur findings revealed that the observed Qmax did not \nsubstantially differ from the mean expected Qmax values, \nindicating a favourable outcome of valve ablation in terms \nof restoring urethral patency, which can otherwise be ob\u00ad\nstructed by remaining valves, strictures, or bladder neck \nstenosis.18 Additionally, we discovered that in the 24 boys \nwho underwent ablation, the mean VV post-ablation was \nsignificantly lower than the mean EBC, suggesting either \na decrease in bladder capacity or an increase in PVR. To \nbetter understand which of the two was most likely, PVR \nwas calculated by subtracting the mean pre-void volume \n(279.05mls) from the mean actual voided urine as per \nuroflowmetry (129.52mls). It was then observed that 19 \nboys (79%) showed a considerably high mean PVR (149.52 \nmls).

Graphical presentation of the flow curve \npattern frequency on uroflowmetry in the 24 boys \nvalve ablation uroflowmetry values for PVR (81 vs 64 mls), \nmaximal bladder capacity (149 vs 167 ml), and Qmax (6 \nvs 8 ml/s), suggesting that valve ablation did not restore \nnor improve bladder function.19 Other previous investiga\u00ad\ntions have found a significant increase in the incidence of \nPVR among patients with PUV post-ablation, with three \ntheories being detailed concerning PVR in the absence of \nbladder outlet obstruction21,22. The first theory proposes \na true residual caused by a hypo-contractile overdistended \nbladder causing incomplete emptying. The second theory \nis that pseudo-residuals are caused by urine reflux into the \nupper tract, which then refills the bladder after voiding. \nThe third explanation is pseudo-pseudo-residuals from a \nhydronephrotic polyuric kidney.23\u201125 Although our study \nlacked pre-ablative uroflowmetry parameters for compari\u00ad\nson, a high PVR was observed in 19 boys (79%), which \nwas most likely due to a combination of true, pseudo, and \npseudo-pseudo residual urine, with mechanical obstruction \nbeing unlikely given the average recorded Qmax. To deter\u00ad\nmine which of the three was the primary cause of the PVR, \nadditional procedures such as VCUG, cystography, or the \nWhitaker test would have been required.24 The remaining 5 \nboys had no significant PVR, as their mean pre-void blad\u00ad\nder capacity (190 mls) matched their mean actual voided \nvolume (175.4 mls), indicating normal detrusor contractil\u00ad\nity and no mechanical obstruction. \nThe flow pattern curve analysis revealed that majority of \nthe boys, 58.3%, had a normal (bell-shaped) flow pattern \nwhile 41.7 % had abnormal curves. A normal flow pattern \nis frequently associated with both low intraurethral pressure \nand normal detrusor contractility.5 Conversely, while the \nflow pattern may help identify the mechanism underlying \nLUTD, neither a typical nor abnormal pattern guarantees \nthe presence of LUTD due to compensatory voiding mech\u00ad\nanisms such as the use of abdominal muscles.5 As a result, \nit is impossible to determine whether our participants had a \nnormal curve pattern due to normal detrusor contractions or \nif it was caused by a urinary system compensating mecha\u00ad\nnism. The flow pattern curve analysis should, therefore, not \nbe read separately but in conjunction with the Qmax since \ncombining the two provides a better knowledge of lower \nurinary tract function and can aid in the identification of \npatients who may require additional intervention or treat\u00ad\nment.26 \nSTUDY STRENGTHS AND \nLIMITATIONS \nThe study recruited participants from a specialized referral \ncentre with a standardized protocol for PUV ablation, en\u00ad\nsuring consistent surgical and post-operative practices. It \nfollowed the ICCS standards, with a single trained staff \nmember conducting all uroflowmetry tests to maintain re\u00ad\nliability. However, the study also faced several limitations. \nThe small sample size and study design were not powered \nto make conclusive inferences on the subject under study. \nWhile the results provide important insights into the post-\nablation urodynamic effects in PUV patients, further \nprospective research with larger, more representative sam\u00ad\nples is necessary to confirm these findings and enhance \ntheir generalizability. Additionally, while uroflowmetry is \na helpful non-invasive tool, its results can be influenced by \nfactors such as hydration status, diurnal variation, psycho\u00ad\nlogical state, and environmental conditions, particularly in \npaediatric patients. These limitations suggest the need for \nmore invasive urodynamic tests to detect subtle abnormali\u00ad\nties. \nCONCLUSION \nUroflowmetry did not find any statistically significant dif\u00ad\nference between the mean expected and observed Q max in \nour cohort of patients after PUV ablation, suggesting ade\u00ad\nquate urethral patency after ablation. However, 79% of par\u00ad\nticipants had significant residual urine volume, and 41.7% \nhad abnormal uroflowmetry curves, which suggested sig\u00ad\nnificant bladder dysfunction. Incorporation of uroflowme\u00ad\ntry as a routine follow-up metric in LMIC protocols can, \ntherefore, provide useful adjuncts in detecting bladder dys\u00ad\nfunction after posterior urethral valve ablation. Uroflowme\u00ad\ntry seems a valuable non-invasive adjunct to follow-up in \nPUV management. \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors would like to thank the RCSI/COSECSA Col\u00ad\nlaboration Programme Global Surgery Research Support \n2023/2024 for funding this study.

INTRODUCTION \nAbdominal wound dehiscence (AWD) is a mechanical fail\u00ad\nure of a healing abdominal surgical wound. The incidence \nof abdominal wound dehiscence ranges from 0.4 to 3.5%, \nand it can reach 10% in the elderly. The associated mor\u00ad\ntality rate reaches up to 45%.1\u20119 Several studies identify \nvarious combinations of factors as risk factors, which are \ntypically classified as local and Systemic factors.2,10 Pa\u00ad\ntient-related comorbidities and procedure-related parame\u00ad\nters such as surgery type, incision and closure type, and \noperation time are among the risk factors. Nevertheless, \nwound infection is the most crucial factor.7,9,11\u201115 \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

Determinants of\nAbdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study. East Cent Afr J Surg.\n2024;29(4):14-23. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.3\nAWD remains a serious postoperative complication de\u00ad\nspite technological and surgical advancements. This is pre\u00ad\ndominantly due to the influence of patient-specific factors.8,\n16,17 AWD is regarded as a reliable indicator of patient \nsafety due to its influence on morbidity, duration of hospital \nstay, including intensive care therapy, readmission rate for \nanother surgery, and health care costs.6,8,11,12 AWD and \nother wound complications increase healthcare costs and \nprolong hospital stays due to increased morbidity, resulting \nin significant economic and psychosocial strain on the pa\u00ad\ntient and the healthcare system. The burden AWD places \non an already overburdened healthcare system in places like \nEthiopia should not be underestimated.14,18\u201120 There are \nvarious modifiable risk factors for AWD that can help re\u00ad\nduce the occurrence of this devastating condition. Identify\u00ad\ning high-risk patients in advance would enable the surgeon \nto take preventative measures during surgery, such as the \napplication of a retention suture or the use of absorbable or \nnon-absorbable meshes.6,17 \nThe purpose of this study is to determine the risk factors \nand magnitude of AWD in two selected hospitals in the \nSidama region of Ethiopia. So far, there have been only two \nreports of this dreadful condition in Ethiopia. The first was \nperformed at St. Paul\u2019s Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. \nThe other was done at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital \nand involved only pediatric patients.2,18 Both studies re\u00ad\nvealed the magnitude of AWD in their respective contexts, \nas well as potential risk factors for AWD, including emer\u00ad\ngency surgery, surgical site infection, and intrabdominal \nsepsis. Both studies lacked a comparison group to reach \ntheir conclusion, which we deemed a major drawback, and \nthe later study only included pediatric cases. Unlike the two \nstudies, this one is a case-control study that includes people \nof all ages. \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n2.1. Study site and period \nThe research was carried out at the departments of surgery \nat two facilities in the Sidama Region, Hawassa University \nComprehensive Specialized Hospital (HUCSH) and Yir\u00ad\ngalam hospital medical college, from February to May \n2023. The Sidama area is located in southern Ethiopia. The \nregion\u2019s major crops are \u2018enset\u2019, wheat, teff, and barley, as \nwell as cereals and coffee as cash crops. Hawassa is the cap\u00ad\nital city of the Sidama region. It is located 274 kilometers \nsouth of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\u2019s capital city. HUCSH is a \ntertiary hospital in Hawassa, Ethiopia. It is the only teach\u00ad\ning-specialized referral hospital in the region. It is a referral \ncenter for patients from the region and nearby areas. It de\u00ad\nlivers services to almost 20 million people. Yirgalem hos\u00ad\npital medical college is 315 kilometers from Addis Ababa. \nIt serves a population of approximately 4 million people. \n2.2. Study design \nA case-control study was used to find out the risk factors \nfor abdominal wound dehiscence and its frequency in pa\u00ad\ntients who had undergone laparatomy for different reasons \nat Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospi\u00ad\ntal (HUCSH) and Yirgalem hospital medical college in the \ndepartment of surgery. \n2.3. Source and study population \nThe source population was all patients who had undergone \nlaparotomy at the two study hospitals. The study population \ncomprised surgical patients from the surgical departments \nof the chosen hospitals who underwent laparotomy within \nthe last five years and developed AWD for cases, and con\u00ad\ntrols who underwent laparotomy within the same time \nframe (April 1, 2018 to January 31, 2023) but did not de\u00ad\nvelop AWD. All pediatric and adult patients who had la\u00ad\nparotomies during the five-year period (April1, 2018 to \nJanuary 31, 2023), both elective and emergency surgeries, \nwere included and patients transferred out, died or referred \nwere excluded \n2.4. Data collection and Data analysis \nThe data were collected using software called the Kobo \nToolbox. This was done once a patient was identified from \nthe operation room (OR) log books using a patient-specific \nidentification number (chart number), which was used to re\u00ad\ntrieve the patient\u2019s chart. Three surgical residents entered \nthe data into the Kobo toolbox. The number of laparotomies \nwas obtained from the OR log books. The operating theater \n(OR) log book of the selected hospitals was used to identify \npatients, and data were extracted from April 2018\u2013 January \n2023. For each identified case of AWD, two controls were \nselected. Controls were not matched to cases based on any \nspecific characterstics. Controls were people who under\u00ad\nwent lararotomy and did not develop AWD. Any two con\u00ad\nsecutive cases on the OR log book close to the identified \ncase of AWD were taken as controls. \nChart review: Three surgical residents reviewed the pa\u00ad\ntients\u2019 charts. Two residents of HUCSH and one resident \nof Yirgalem hospital medical college were assigned. Chart \nnumbers were traced from the OR log book, and charts of \na specific patient, both a case of AWD and respective con\u00ad\ntrols, were reviewed thoroughly. The data was then entered \ninto the Kobo toolbox. The data included socioeconomic \ncharacteristics, preoperative risk assessment, and intraoper\u00ad\native and postoperative risk assessment. \nAfter editing, the data were exported from the Kobo \ntoolbox to SPSS software version 26 for analysis. Descrip\u00ad\ntive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were used to \nsummarise the study participants relationship to the study \nvariables. Texts, tables, and charts were used to display the \nresults. Chi-squared test ,Fisher\u2019s exact tests, and Mann-\nWhitney U test were used as appropriate, to explore the as\u00ad\nDeterminants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n15\nsociation between categorical variables. Univariate binary \nlogistic regression analysis was employed to assess the re\u00ad\nlationship between individual potential risk factors and the \nevent. Consequently, the factors that were statistically sig\u00ad\nnificant (p < 0.05) or clinically pertinent to the event were \nincorporated into a multivariable binary logistic regression \nmodel to ascertain independent predictors. Results were \npresented using crude odds ratios (COR), adjusted odds ra\u00ad\ntios (AOR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values. \nAll significance tests were two-tailed and P<0.05 was con\u00ad\nsidered significant. Variables which do not fulfill the as\u00ad\nsumptions of biniary logistic regression were exluded from \nboth univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression \nanalyses. \n3.2. Ethical considerations \nEthical clearance was obtained from the Hawassa Univer\u00ad\nsity College of Medicine and Health Science Institutional \nReview Board (IRB) and the IRB number is IRB/069/14. \n4. RESULTS \nWe included 196 patients and 63 were cases of abdominal \nwound dehiscence and 133 were controls. The total number \nof laparotomies performed during the study period was \n3792, of which 1270 (33.5%) were elective and 2522 \n(66.5%) were emergency procedures. 1206 (31.8%) were \npediatric patients, and 2586 (68.2%) were adults. The mag\u00ad\nnitude of abdominal wound dehiscence in our study was 63 \n(1.66%). \nSocio-demographic characteristics \nOut of the study subjects, only five (7.93%) of the cases \nwere above the age of 61. As to place of residence, those \nfrom rural areas accounted for 66 (33.67%), while those \nfrom urban areas accounted for 48 (24.5%). (Table 1). \nPre-operative conditions \nIn our study, regarding the preoperative risk assessment, 37 \n(65%) of cases versus 20 (35%) of controls had anemia, \nwith a P-value of <0.001. The majority of cases underwent \n(58 of 63, 92.1%) emergency surgery, compared to 86 out \nof 133 controls (64.7%). (Table 2) \nIntraoperative and postoperative risk \nassessment variables \nRegarding the type of surgical incisions, 47 (74.6%) of the \ncases and 61 (45.8%) of the controls underwent a midline \nvertical incision, which is the commonest type of incision. \nOf the hospital deaths, most were cases (13, 76.5%). (Table \n3). \nIn our study, 54 (85.7%) of the cases had an acute ab\u00ad\ndomen of different etiologies. Intestinal obstruction of var\u00ad\nious benign pathologies, followed by appendicitis and its \ncomplications, were the commonest intraoperative diag\u00ad\nnoses among cases of AWD (25 and 15 cases, respectively). \n(Fig.1) \nAbdominal wound dehiscence and its \nfeatures \n58 out 63, 92.1% of the cases developed a complete wound \ndehiscence. About two-thirds of the cases (42 out of 63, \n66.7%) developed WD within 6\u201310 days after laparotomy. \nThe majority (88.8%) of the cases were re-operated . Exlud\u00ad\ning those who died, the median length of hospital stay was \nsignificantly longer for cases (22 days; IQR: 13.75\u201330) \ncompared to controls (6 days; IQR: 3\u20139; p < 0.001, Mann-\nWhitney U test).(Table 3) \nTrend of abdominal wound dehiscence \nThe trends of AWD in the study hospitals showed decreas\u00ad\ning trends from late 2018 to early 2019, and the trend \nplateaued in the subsequent three years (until late 2021) \nwith a yearly case of 13. However, the trend dropped faster, \nfrom 13 to 8 cases in 2022 until early 2023. (Figure 2). \nFactors associated with WD \nVariables were put into the binary logistic regression model \nfor univariate and multivariable analyses. When possible \nconfounding factors were taken into account, place of res\u00ad\nidence, anemia, emergency surgery, and the presence of \npost-operative complications were significantly associated \nstatistically with abdominal wound dehiscence. (Table 4) \n5. Discussion \nThe study found a magnitude of 1.66% and a variety of fac\u00ad\ntors to be statistically linked with AWD in the study area. \nThese included the patients\u2019 residency, post-operative com\u00ad\nplications (SSI, anastomotic leak, HAP), anemia, and emer\u00ad\ngency surgery. \nThis hospital-based study showed that the magnitude \nof AWD was 63 (1.66%). This was slightly higher than \nthe study done in St. Paul,Ethiopia (0.99%).2 This value is \ncomparable with a study done in Sarajevo and India.6,12,15,\n16 Even though the incidence differs across hospitals and \nsettings, it is consistent with the global report stating the \nwound dehiscence (WD) ranges from 0.4\u20133.5.1\u20115,7\u20119 How\u00ad\never, in a study done in pakistan, it was 4.42%,3 it was 6.9% \nin a study done in Argentina10 and a study done in a uni\u00ad\nversity set up in Egypt ,the frequency was 7.3%.17 Another \nstudy done in addiss ababa,Ethiopia which was on pediatric \ncases showed an incidence of 7.9%.18 The high incidence \nin these studies could be due to the presence of multiple co\u00ad\nmorbidities, poor nurtritional status, delayed presentation, \na higher proportion of emergency surgeries or due to ad\u00ad\nDeterminants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n16\nTable 1.

This discovery has never been men\u00ad\ntioned in prior studies. This is one of the study\u2019s original \nfindings. The patients\u2019 poor nutritional status or their de\u00ad\nlayed presentation to medical facilities due to access or \nknowledge issues could be the causes, but this variable \nneeds more research. \nThe study identified postoperative complications as a \nstrong risk factor for AWD and were associated with a \ntwenty-fold increased risk of wound dehiscence. Previous, \ncomparable studies supported our evidence .2,4,5,7,11,15,17,\n18,20,21 \nEmergency abdominal surgery was another significant \nrisk factor that was determined to be strongly associated \nwith AWD. Patients who underwent emergency abdominal \nsurgery in this hospital-based study had higher odds of de\u00ad\nveloping AWD (AOR = 10.17) than those who underwent \nelective procedures. In a case-control study carried out in \nPoland, this was thoroughly validated.5 The patient\u2019s poor \noverall health, the high likelihood that the surgical wound \nwill become contaminated, and the possibilities that the \nsurgical team\u2019s performance may be jeopardized are some \nof the contributing factors. Of the cases in our study, 54 \n(85.7%) had acute abdomens of various etiologies. This is \nconsistent with a number of other studies, including those \nconducted in Egypt and India, where 70% of AWD cases \nhad an acute abdomen.4,15,17,22 In these studies, viscus per\u00ad\nforation from a variety of etiologies was the main contribu\u00ad\ntor to acute abdomen. In the Addis Ababa, Ethiopia study, \nacute abdomen was the main contributing factor.2 \nIntestinal obstruction and acute appendicitis with its \ncomplications were the two most frequently performed pro\u00ad\ncedures among the cases. In 57 cases (90.47%), the patholo\u00ad\ngies were benign. In contrast, a Sarajevo study discovered \nthat the majority (40.1%) of abdominal wound dehiscence \ncases occurred following surgery for colorectal cancer and \nDeterminants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n18\nFigure 1. Summary of the Intraoperative diagnoses of the cases of abdominal wound dehiscence and \ncontrols, Sidama region, Ethiopia, 2023 \nFigure 2. Trends of AWD with respect to total \nlaparotomy done each year, Sidama region, Ethiopia, \n2023 \nthat 52.2% of all cases of abdominal wound dehiscence \nwere malignant.16 84.9% of the patients in a Turkish study \nhad undergone surgery for a malignancy.20 Our research \nshows that malignancy is much less frequent than benign \npathologies, which may be because malignancy is uncom\u00ad\nmon in younger populations. However, due attention should \nalso be paid to benign pathologies to minimize the develop\u00ad\nment of abdominal wound dehiscence. \nOur research also revealed that anemia was a significant \nrisk factor for AWD. The odds of developing AWD were \napproximately four times higher in patients who had un\u00ad\ndergone laparotomy and had anemia than in patients who \ndid not. This is supported by earlier comparable studies \nconducted elsewhere that show strong associations between \nanemia and wound dehiscence.11,15,16 But in another study \ndone in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia no strong association was \nfound between anemia and wound dehiscence.18 \nIn this study 61(96.8%) of the cases had a long hospital \nstay compared to 44 (33.1%) of the controls. This is sig\u00ad\nnificant with a P-value of <0.001. This demonstrates how \nabdominal wound dehiscence increases a patient\u2019s hospital \nstay with its associated consequences. This has been \ndemonstrated in several studies. A case-control study con\u00ad\nducted in Poland showed that the increased length of hospi\u00ad\ntal stay among cases was statistically significant compared \nto controls .5,7 This was also demonstrated in a study con\u00ad\nducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.18 \nIn the current study, majority (67%) of the wound de\u00ad\nhiscences\u2019 developed within 6 to 10 days of post laparo\u00ad\ntomy. The findings is in line with similar study conducted \nin addis ababa,Ethiopia revealing 58.5% of WD happened \nwithin similar time period.2 It is also similar with a study \ndone in Pakistan.3 In a study done in Argentina majority of \nthe cases occurred on the 9th post-operative day.10 Accord\u00ad\ning to Ramshort et.al 90% of cases of abdominal wound de\u00ad\nhiscence occur before the 15th post-operative day.16 \nIn this study, males (38 of 63, 60.3%) experienced ab\u00ad\ndominal wound dehiscence. Numerous studies have found \nthat to be the case.2,3,15,16 In fact, age (being older) and \nsex (being a man) are two risk factors that are frequently \nmentioned in studies.10,11,19 In a study conducted in Addis \nAbaba, Ethiopia, there was no connection between sex and \nwound dehiscence.18 In our study, (44 out of 63, 69.8%) of \nthe abdominal wound dehiscence cases were between the \nDeterminants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n19\nTable 4.

This was comparable to the St. Paul, \nEthiopia study.2 The same was the case with an Indian \nstudy.22 The high proportion of young people in the study \npopulation may be the cause of this. Similar research was \nconducted in India, where the majority of cases were in \ntheir fourth decade of life.15 In contrast, a study conducted \nin Sarajevo found that the majority of cases occurred in \npeople between the ages of 71 and 80.16 In our study, only \n5 (7.93%) of the cases were over the age of 61. \nIn contrast to some studies where the majority of the \npopulation was elderly, age and gender were not discovered \nin this study to be independent risk factors for the devel\u00ad\nopment of wound dehiscence. This was discovered in both \nan Egyptian and an Indian study.21,23 Age and gender were \nnot found to have a statistically significant association in a \ncase-control validation study carried out in Poland .5,7 \nOnly 5 (7.9%) of the cases in this study had COPD, hy\u00ad\npertension, or diabetes mellitus (DM) as comorbid condi\u00ad\ntions. This might be as a result of the higher percentage of \nyoung patients in this study than in other studies. As a re\u00ad\nsult, these people have hardly any co-morbidities. COPD \nis one of the main independent risk factors documented in \nthe literature.10,11 In contrast, a study conducted in Turkey \nfound no evidence that COPD was significantly linked to \nthe emergence of wound dehiscence.20 \nLIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY \nIt is challenging to extrapolate the study\u2019s results to the \ncountry or the continent as a whole because it is facility-\nbased and only includes two centers. Given that the sec\u00ad\nondary data were retrieved retrospectively from patient \nmedical records, another limitation of the current study is \nthe incompleteness of the records of some variables that \nmight have an association with abdominal wound dehis\u00ad\ncence and led to exclusion of them in regression analyses. \n6. CONCLUSION \nIn this study, an AWD of 1.66 was found, and it was found \nthat the patients\u2019 place of residence, postoperative compli\u00ad\ncations (SSI, anastomotic leak, HAP), anemia ,and emer\u00ad\ngency surgery, were all significant predictors of AWD de\u00ad\nvelopment. We suggest giving patients from rural areas \nand those undergoing emergency surgery more attention. \nPrompt measures should be taken to prevent the develop\u00ad\nment of postoperative complications; the root cause of ane\u00ad\nmia must be addressed whenever possible. Every patient\u2019s \nmedical history must be meticulously recorded. \n7. RECOMMENDATIONS \nThis study is one of the few to evaluate the magnitude \nof abdominal wound dehiscence and its risk factors in the \ncountry. Future studies might involve many patients and \nmultiple centers prospectively. This would make it possible \nto identify independent risk factors more precisely, allow\u00ad\ning us to identify patients who are at a high risk of devel\u00ad\noping dehiscence and quickly take the necessary preventive \nactions. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe are grateful for the opportunity to undertake this re\u00ad\nsearch, which was made possible by Hawassa University. \nDeterminants of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence: A Case-Control Study\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n20\nThe research directorate of Hawassa University College of \nMedicine and Health Sciences deserves special recogni\u00ad\ntion for its remarkable collaboration.

Motorcycle users are highly vulnerable to accidents, resulting in rising \northopedic related morbidity and mortality. In Malawi, the surge in motorbike taxi services has led to a notable increase in \nmotorbike-related road accidents. \nObjectives \nThis study aimed to assess the pattern of orthopedic injuries, examine demographic characteristics, and analyze the \nmechanisms of injuries among motorcycle trauma patients admitted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital. \nMethods \nA retrospective study was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Malawi. We included all orthopedic surgery \ndata from ward admissions records from January to December 2021. Data were extracted from patients\u2019 files and stored on \nREDCap and analyzed using SPSS version 27. \nResults \nA total of 502 motorbike and non-motorbike road traffic trauma patients were recorded in the inpatient orthopedic trauma \ndatabase. Of these, 453 patients\u2019 files were identified and analyzed, while 9.7% (49/502) files were missing. Amongst the 453 \npatients\u2019 files identified, those that suffered motorcycle injuries were 63.4% (287/453) of all road traffic accidents. Most of \nthese accidents occurred in urban areas 64.1% (168/266). The age range was 8 to 78 years with most falling within age group \nof between 21 and 40, 53.7% (154/287). The majority, 78.7% (226/287), were male. Collisions between motorcycles and cars \nwere the most common mechanism of injury 41.6% (119/286). Motorcycle drivers constituted the largest group of victims \n42.8% (118/276) and majority of victims did not use helmets 83.1% (74/89). The most frequent orthopedic injury pattern was \nfractures of the tibia and fibula accounting for 44.6% (128/287) of injured patients, with highest likelihood of being open \n57.8% (59/102). Greater number of orthopedic injuries, 70.1% (199/284), were treated surgically. The commonest duration of \nhospital stay was ranging from 1 week to 1 month with most being discharged within 14 days, 43.9% (125/285). \nConclusion \nMotorcycle related accidents is public health challenge in Malawi and similar LMICs, leading to a high burden of morbidity \nand mortality, primarily affecting the productive age group with long impact on health system to spend long time in hospital, \nrequiring surgical provision. Policymakers should consider preventive measures, as the treatment of these injuries strains \nalready limited hospital resources and contributes to poor patient outcomes. \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

East Cent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(4):24-35.\ndoi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.4\nINTRODUCTION \nGlobally, road traffic accidents (RTA) are on the rise with \nmotorcycle users being among the most vulnerable groups. \nThey are prone to encountering high morbidity and mortal\u00ad\nity. According to World Health Organization (WHO), ap\u00ad\nproximately 1.3 million people globally die each year due \nto road traffic crashes, with 20 to 50 million more people \nsustaining non-fatal injuries leaving them with significant \ndisabilities.1 Approximately 93% of the world\u2019s fatalities \non the roads happen in low and middle-income countries \n(LMICs) even though roughly 60% of the world\u2019s vehicles \ndwell in these settings. It is estimated that more than half of \nall road traffic deaths are among vulnerable users including \nmotorcyclists.1 \nThe burden of Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) is on the rise, \ncausing significant economic losses to individuals, their \nfamilies, and nations. Even in developed countries, people \nfrom lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to \nbe involved in road traffic accidents. The economic bur\u00ad\ndens resulting from these accidents are multifaceted, stem\u00ad\nming from treatment costs, loss of productivity and valu\u00ad\nable working time for victims and relatives, loss of skilled \nlabor force, and loss of school hours. Road traffic accidents \nimpose substantial economic costs, with most countries los\u00ad\ning approximately 3% of their Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP) annually.1 Furthermore, RTIs have become the lead\u00ad\ning cause of death among people aged 5-29 years, dispro\u00ad\nportionately affecting vulnerable groups such as pedestri\u00ad\nans, cyclists, and motorcyclists, particularly those living in \ndeveloping countries.1,2 \nIt is estimated that approximately 770 million motorcy\u00ad\ncles are on the roads worldwide, engaging in various ac\u00ad\ntivities.3 In developing nations, motorcycles are utilized for \nessential responsibilities related to transportation and eco\u00ad\nnomic activities. Motorcycle accidents account for more \nthan 380,000 annual deaths globally, with 28% of fatalities \noccurring in 2016, primarily in the African region.2,3 Sub-\nSaharan Africa, in particular, faces a rapidly increasing bur\u00ad\nden of trauma from road accidents, which has been termed \n\u201cAfrica\u2019s silent epidemic\u201d.4 \nIn developing countries, motorcycle injuries have be\u00ad\ncome a pressing yet overlooked public health concern, sub\u00ad\nstantially contributing to road traffic accidents and fatali\u00ad\nties.5,6 In spite of the increased risks which is reported to be \n30 times more likely to be fatal and eight times more likely \nto result in injury compared to other vehicles, motorcycles \nare increasingly popular due to their convenience.7 Com\u00ad\nmercial motorcycling has become widespread in rural and \nurban areas, leading to significant morbidity and mortality, \nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where young people rely \non motorcycles for transportation and livelihood, driven by \nhigh unemployment rates.5 \nMalawi is experiencing rapid economic growth and a \nsurge in motor vehicle registrations, including motorcycles. \nThe country\u2019s estimated road traffic fatality rate stands at \n35 deaths per 100,000 people per year, the second-highest \nglobally.8,9 In Malawi, as in other developing countries, \nmotorcycle road traffic accidents are rising due to increased \nmotorcycle taxi operations. Most motorcyclists operate ille\u00ad\ngally, lacking driver\u2019s licenses and helmets, putting them\u00ad\nselves and vulnerable road users at greater risk. Their lim\u00ad\nited knowledge of road traffic rules exacerbates this risk. \nConsequently, crash victims often present to hospitals with \nvarious injuries, frequently including orthopedic trauma. \nDespite the growing number of trauma patients and sub\u00ad\nstandard care leading to poor outcomes, research remains \nscarce. This study aimed to investigate patterns of orthope\u00ad\ndic injuries, demographic characteristics, and injury mech\u00ad\nanisms among motorcycle trauma patients admitted to \nQueen Elizabeth Central Hospital. \nMETHODS AND MATERIAL \nA retrospective study was conducted at Queen Elizabeth \nCentral Hospital (QECH), the largest referral and teaching \nhospital in Blantyre, southern Malawi. QECH primarily \nserves the southern region, comprising 13 districts with a \npopulation of approximately 7.75 million.10 Due to the lack \nof a district hospital in Blantyre, QECH also provides pri\u00ad\nmary and secondary services. The hospital has a bed capac\u00ad\nity of 1,200. \nData on road traffic accident (RTA) patients from Jan\u00ad\nuary to December 2021 were retrieved from an electroni\u00ad\ncally maintained orthopedic database. This information fa\u00ad\ncilitated the location and identification of patients\u2019 files \nfrom the hospital\u2019s Health Management Information Sys\u00ad\ntem (HMIS) office. All available patient files admitted to \northopedic wards due to RTA were collected, and the total \nnumber was recorded. From this total, only files of patients \ninvolved in motorcycle accidents were selected and stored \nusing Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). \nThe following data were collected: demographics (age, \ngender, education status, occupation, and place of resi\u00ad\ndence); accident details (accident scene, mechanism of in\u00ad\njury, patient\u2019s role, and helmet use); clinical information \n(presenting features, associated injuries, treatments, and du\u00ad\nration of hospital stay); and treatment outcome (discharged \nor deceased). Injury patterns were noted by reviewing doc\u00ad\numented diagnoses based on clinical and radiographic as\u00ad\nsessments. \nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, \nwith categorical variables presented as frequencies and per\u00ad\ncentages, and continuous variables described using means \nand standard deviations. \nFor inferential statistics, the chi-square test was em\u00ad\nployed to examine the association between dependent and \nindependent variables. Additionally, binary logistic regres\u00ad\nsion analysis was conducted to determine the magnitude \nand direction of association, yielding crude and adjusted \nodds ratios. All inferential statistical tests were performed \nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n25\nFigure 1. Total Number of Road Traffic Injured Patients Admitted to Orthopedic Wards with Different Modes \nof Injury \nat a 95% confidence level using SPSS version 27. A p-value \n< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \nThis study received approval from both the Hospital Re\u00ad\nsearch Committee and College of Medicine Research and \nEthics Committee (COMREC). \nRESULTS \nA total of 502 road traffic trauma patients were recorded \nin the inpatient orthopedic trauma database. Of these, 453 \npatients\u2019 files were identified and analyzed, while 49 files, \nrepresenting 9.7% (49/502), were missing and hence not \nanalyzed. Among the 453 analyzed patient files, 287 pa\u00ad\ntients, representing 63.4%, (287/453), suffered motorcycle \ninjuries, accounting for the majority of road traffic acci\u00ad\ndents (Fig. 1). \nDemographic Features of the Groups \nCommonly Involved in Motorcycle \nAccidents. \nGender \nMost of the victims in this study were male, 78.7% (226/\n287) whereas 21.3% (61/287) were female. \nAge \nThe age range of patients was 8 to 78 years, with the major\u00ad\nity falling within the productive age group of 21 to 40 years, \n53.7% (154/287). The mean age was 34.4 (SD 13.8). \nEducation \nData on education status was unavailable for 69.3% (199/\n287) of patients. Among the remaining patients with avail\u00ad\nable data, 40.9% (36/88) had attended primary education as \ntheir highest level of education, 27.2% (24/88) of patients \nhad attended secondary education, 20.4% (18/88) of pa\u00ad\ntients had attended tertiary education. Notably, 11.4% (10/\n88) of patients did not attend any formal education. \nOccupation \nOccupation status data was available for only 38.3% (110/\n287) of patients. Among these, the majority were business\u00ad\npeople, including motorbike taxi operators, accounting for \n45.5% (50/110) of the sample. Workers/employees com\u00ad\nprised 22.7% (25/110) of the patients, followed by farmers \nat 19.1% (21/110) and students at 12.7% (14/110). \nArea of Occurrence of Motorbike Accidents \nThere was missing data in 7.3% (21/287) of the study popu\u00ad\nlation about the area of occurrence of motorbike accidents. \nHowever, among those with available data, urban areas \nhad a higher incidence rate of motorcycle accidents, 64.1% \n(168/266), compared to rural areas, 35.9% (94/266). The \nhighest rate was observed in Blantyre urban, 56.7% (151/\n266), and very few in Blantyre rural, 6.8% (18/266). The \nreferral cases from areas outside Blantyre accounted for \n36.5% (97/266). \nRole of the patient \nData on the patient\u2019s role at the time of the accident was \navailable for 96.2% (276/287) of the study population. The \nmajority of victims were motorcycle drivers, 42.8%, (118/\n276), followed by passengers, 36.2% (100/276) and pedes\u00ad\ntrians 21.0% (58/276). \nRelationship between Socio-demographic \nCharacteristics and Motorcycle Accidents \nInvolvement \nA chi-square test at a 95% confidence level examined the \nassociation between patients\u2019 demographic characteristics \nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n26\nand their involvement in motorbike accidents. For this \nanalysis, involvement was categorized as active (drivers/\npassengers, referred to as motorbike users) or passive \n(pedestrians, referred to as non-motorbike users). \nThe results, presented in Table 2, reveal significant asso\u00ad\nciations between active involvement in accidents and three \ndemographic factors: age (p = 0.001), accident site (p = \n0.014), and area of residence (p = 0.013). Conversely, no \nsignificant relationships were found between active in\u00ad\nvolvement and gender (p = 0.38), occupation (p = 0.371), \nor education (p = 0.179). \nBased on logistic regression analysis, patients aged \n21-40 were 3.15 times more likely to be actively involved \nin motorbike accidents compared to those aged 0-20 (AOR \n3.15, 95% CI: 1.433-6.939). Similarly, patients aged 41-60 \nhad a 3.5-fold increased likelihood (AOR 3.5, 95% CI: \n1.332-9.185). Conversely, patients over 60 were 65% less \nlikely to be involved (AOR 0.349, 95% CI: 0.09-1.36). \nPatients with urban accident locations were 1.35 times \nmore likely to be actively involved in motorbike accidents \nthan those with rural locations (AOR 1.348, 95% CI: \n0.323-5.617). In Blantyre, urban residents had a 1.36-fold \nincreased likelihood of active involvement compared to \nrural residents (AOR 1.364, 95% CI: 0.317-5.863). No\u00ad\ntably, residents outside Blantyre district (referral areas) \nwere 3.54 times more likely to be actively involved than \nBlantyre rural residents (AOR 3.54, 95% CI: 0.939-13.35). \nMechanism of Injuries among Motorcycle \nTrauma Patients \nOnly one victim (0.3%, 1/287) lacked data on motorcycle \ninjury mechanism. Among those with data, collisions be\u00ad\ntween motorcycles and cars were the most common injury \nmechanism, accounting for 41.6% (119/286) of cases \n(Table 3). \nOutcome on Discharge \nThree patients (3/287) lacked discharge outcome documen\u00ad\ntation, resulting in 1% missing data. Among those with \ndata, the majority were discharged home, 97.5% (277/284), \nwhile 2.5% (7/284) died during treatment. Notably, 85.7% \n(6/7) of deceased patients had concomitant non-orthopedic \ninjuries, and 71.4% (5/7) succumbed within 7 days of or\u00ad\nthopedic admission. \nRelationship between Demographic \nCharacteristics, Injury Mechanism, Length \nof Hospital Stay and Survival (Treatment \nOutcome) \nA chi-square test analyzed the relationship between gender, \nage, injury mechanism, length of stay, and discharge out\u00ad\ncome. The results, presented in Table 4, showed significant \nassociations between discharge outcome and two variables: \ninjury mechanism (p = 0.017) and length of stay (p = \n0.001). In contrast, no significant relationships were found \nbetween discharge outcome and gender (p = 0.621) or age \n(p = 0.500). \nLogistic regression analysis revealed that patients in\u00ad\nvolved in motorbike-car collisions were 14.76 times more \nlikely to die compared to those with non-motorbike car col\u00ad\nlisions (AOR 14.76, 95% CI 1.619-34.65). Non-motorbike \ncar collisions included falls from motorbikes after losing \ncontrol, motorbike-motorbike collisions, and pedestrians hit \nby motorbikes. \nRegarding hospital stay duration, patients staying over a \nweek were 95.8% less likely to die compared to those stay\u00ad\ning less than a week (AOR 0.042, 95% CI 0.007-0.242). \nThis indicates that deceased patients were more likely to die \nwithin the first week of admission. \nPatterns of Orthopedic Injuries in \nMotorcycle Accidents. \nThe most frequent orthopedic injury pattern was lower limb \nfractures, with the tibia and fibula being the most common \namong the patients, 44.6% (128/287), followed by femur \nfractures 30.7% (88/287) (Table 5). \nA similar trend in injury patterns was observed across \nboth genders, with tibia and fibula fractures being the most \ncommon (Fig. 2). Similarly, tibia and fibula fractures pre\u00ad\ndominated across age groups, except among those under 20, \nwhere femur fractures were most prevalent (Fig. 3). \nRelationship between Gender, Age, \nMechanism of Injury and Injury Pattern \nA chi-square test of association was conducted to examine \nthe relationship between gender, age, mechanism of injury, \nand patterns of injury. Injury patterns were categorized into \nlower limb fractures and upper limb fractures. Mechanisms \nof injury were classified into two groups: vehicle collisions \n(e.g., motorbike-motorbike, motorbike-car collisions) and \nnon-vehicle collisions (e.g., falls from motorbikes after los\u00ad\ning control, being hit by a motorbike). The results showed \nno statistically significant association between any of the \nvariables and injury patterns (p > 0.05). \nFracture Patterns: Open vs. Closed \nClosed fractures comprised 64.5% (185/287) of all frac\u00ad\ntures, while open fractures accounted for 35.5% (102/287). \nAmong the open fractures (n=102), tibia/fibula fractures \nrepresented 57.8% (59/102). A chi-square test of associa\u00ad\ntion between fracture location and openness revealed a sig\u00ad\nnificant correlation between tibia/fibula fractures and in\u00ad\ncreased likelihood of being open (p=0.001). Notably, \n46.1% (59/128) of tibia/fibula fractures were open. \nBased on the logistic regression analysis, patients with \ntibia/fibula fractures were 2.31 times more likely to have an \nopen fracture compared to those with other fractures com\u00ad\nbined (odds ratio: 2.307; 95% CI: 1.409-3.777). \nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n27\nTable 1.

Additionally, the inherent vulnerability of \nmotorbikes due to their lack of protective features com\u00ad\npared to enclosed vehicles further elevates the risk. Conse\u00ad\nquently, these factors increase the likelihood of accidents \nand injuries among motorcyclists and other vulnerable road \nusers.11,12 \nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n29\nTable 4.

This disparity may be attributed to the higher mo\u00ad\ntorcycle usage in urban areas, driven by increased business \nactivity and commuting. Furthermore, elevated road traffic \nin urban areas increases the likelihood of collisions with \nother vehicles. However, potential biases in case reporting \nmay also contribute to this disparity. Specifically, some or\u00ad\nthopedic trauma patients from district accidents may not be \nreferred to our facility, while severely injured patients from \ndistant areas may succumb to injuries before arrival. No\u00ad\ntably, Blantyre\u2019s lack of a district hospital funnels patients \ndirectly to our facility, potentially increasing Blantyre ur\u00ad\nban accident numbers. \nThe majority of patients involved in motorbike accidents \nwere businesspeople, including motorbike taxi operators. \nThis finding is consistent with previous studies highlighting \nthe increased risk of road traffic injuries among commercial \nmotorcyclists.11 The high representation of motorbike taxi \noperators in our findings may be attributed to their in\u00ad\ncreased exposure to road traffic, prolonged working hours, \nand potentially hazardous driving practices. Additionally, \nworkers/employees, farmers, and students were also com\u00ad\nmonly involved in motorbike accidents. \nThis study revealed that 78% of motorcycle injury vic\u00ad\ntims were males in their reproductive years, likely attribut\u00ad\nable to socioeconomic factors. Men are more likely to use \nmotorcycles as employment or transport to their job. It is \nnot uncommon to see men driving motorcycles and engag\u00ad\nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n30\nTable 5.

No\u00ad\ntably, no female victims in this study were the drivers at \nthe time of accidents reflecting societal norms influenced \nby cultural backgrounds. Young men frequently engage in \nleisure driving, increasing their likelihood of drinking and \ndriving, speeding, and other risky behaviors. Consistent \nwith prior research, males in their productive years exhibit \nhigh motorcycle accident rates due to reckless riding prac\u00ad\ntices, including helmet avoidance, overloading, speeding, \nand substance-impaired driving.11\u201113 \nA significant proportion of motorcycle accident victims \nhad a low educational background, with a substantial ma\u00ad\njority having only completed primary education as their \nhighest level of educational attainment. This finding is con\u00ad\nsistent with existing research, which has consistently \ndemonstrated that individuals with elementary education \nare disproportionately represented in motorcycle road acci\u00ad\ndents, and are more likely to experience high case fatali\u00ad\nties.14,15 Individuals with little or no education are likely \nto come from low socioeconomic background and therefore \nare inclined to choosing the cheapest mode of transporta\u00ad\ntion including motorcycles. They are also likely to engage \nin motorbike taxi operations as their business to generate \nincome to support their families. Generally, less educated \npeople are less likely to drive cautiously, less aware of traf\u00ad\nfic rules and regulations and therefore prone to fatal acci\u00ad\ndents. \nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n31\nFigure 3. Patterns of Orthopedic Injuries Across all Age Groups \nIn this study, collisions between motorcycles and other \nvehicles were found to be the most common mechanism \nof injury, consistent with observations in similar studies.11,\n16\u201118 Motorcycle drivers themselves were the most frequent \nvictims of accidents, followed by passengers. As most mo\u00ad\ntorcycle riding occurs in urban settings, where other vehi\u00ad\ncles are numerous, the likelihood of motorcycles colliding \nwith cars is high, particularly when navigating through traf\u00ad\nfic congestion. In developing countries, poor road condi\u00ad\ntions, overspeeding, and overloading of vehicles and mo\u00ad\ntorcycles with passengers or luggage increase the risk of \ncollisions between motorcycles, other vehicles and pedes\u00ad\ntrians. This situation is exacerbated by a lack of understand\u00ad\ning and/or adherence to road traffic signs and signals among \nmany road users. \nSeveral studies have demonstrated that motorcycle \ntrauma victims present to hospital with different pattern of \ninjuries including neurosurgery, general surgery and ortho\u00ad\npedic surgery trauma conditions but orthopedic injuries are \ncommonly encountered.5,12 The most common pattern of \northopedic injuries in this study was that of lower limbs \nwith fractures of tibia/fibula being the commonest followed \nby femur fractures. Our findings are consistent with similar \nstudies done elsewhere which demonstrated similar pattern, \nwith the fractures of tibia/fibula being the commonest.7,11,\n12,19 Due to anatomical position and superficial subcuta\u00ad\nneous location of the tibia/fibula, they are prone to frac\u00ad\nture and are highly susceptible to becoming open fractures \nduring road traffic accidents.20,21 Notably, our study found \nthat 46.1% of all tibia fractures were open. However, of \nall the fractures together, 35.5% were open with tibia/fibula \nfractures accounting for 57.8% of these open fractures. \nThe global burden of orthopedic injuries is substantial, \nexerting significant pressure on healthcare resources, in\u00ad\ncluding in low-resource settings like Malawi. The conse\u00ad\nquences of these injuries are devastating, affecting not only \nthe individual but also their families and communities. Pro\u00ad\nlonged hospitalizations result in increased healthcare uti\u00ad\nlization, reduced productivity, and long-term disability.11 \nOur study\u2019s findings indicate that hospital stays for ortho\u00ad\npedic injuries ranged from less than 7 to more than 30 days, \nwith a median duration of 14 days. Injury severity, pat\u00ad\ntern, and treatment modality significantly influenced hospi\u00ad\ntalization duration. Notably, surgical intervention was the \nprimary treatment approach, yielding shorter hospital stays \ncompared to conservative management with skeletal or skin \ntraction. This is consistent with existing literature, which \nhighlights the impact of multiple injuries and comorbidities \non prolonged hospitalization.11 \nThis study found a 2.5% mortality rate among orthope\u00ad\ndic ward admissions, contrasting with similar studies done \nin Egypt (1.9%) and Pakistan (1.1%).11,12 The higher mor\u00ad\ntality rate in our study may be attributed to concomitant \nlife-threatening non-orthopedic injuries, potentially over\u00ad\nlooked or missed during admission. Our study found that \nthose that died, 85.7% had concomitant non-orthopedic in\u00ad\njuries and head injury was the commonest. Other study \nfindings have revealed head injury as the leading cause of \ndeath in trauma patients.12,22 Most deaths (72.7%) occurred \nwithin 7 days of admission, but specific causes of death \nwere not recorded in our study. \nNotably, when considering all motorbike trauma pa\u00ad\ntients, regardless of whether they sustained orthopedic and/\nor other injuries, the mortality rate exceeds the rate ob\u00ad\nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n32\nserved in our study.12,13,17 Our findings indicate that col\u00ad\nlision between motorcycle and a car was significantly as\u00ad\nsociated with increased mortality, likely attributable to the \nhigh-energy impact and resultant multiple injuries. \nThe study\u2019s reliance on patient file data introduces po\u00ad\ntential biases and limitations characteristic of retrospective \nresearch. Specifically, missing and incomplete data were \nencountered in some variables under investigation. Another \nlimitation stems from the potential bias introduced by miss\u00ad\ning patient\u2019s files and the exclusion of multisystem injured \npatients admitted to wards outside the orthopedic depart\u00ad\nment. Furthermore, this single-centered study creates a se\u00ad\nlection bias that potentially would affect external validity. \nThese limitations may impact the generalizability and \nrepresentativeness of the findings. To address these con\u00ad\ncerns, future studies should consider several key improve\u00ad\nments. Specifically, adopting multicenter designs would en\u00ad\nhance external validity, while comprehensive data \ncollection strategies would minimize missing values. Addi\u00ad\ntionally, employing inclusive criteria would capture diverse \npatient populations, and implementing strategies to mitigate \nselection bias would strengthen the reliability of the results. \nFurthermore, conducting prospective studies would provide \nmore accurate and reliable data. \nDespite the limitations, this study contributes signifi\u00ad\ncantly to our understanding of the epidemiological char\u00ad\nacteristics surrounding motorcycle accidents. The findings \nhave important implications for prevention strategies, pol\u00ad\nicy development, and healthcare resource allocation fo\u00ad\ncused on mitigating the impact of motorcycle accidents. Fu\u00ad\nture research can enhance these results by employing more \nsuperior study designs, ultimately yielding higher-quality \nevidence to inform motorcycle safety initiatives. \nCONCLUSION AND \nRECOMMENDATIONS \nMotorcycle accidents are a frequent cause of road traffic \naccidents and pose a significant public health challenge in \nMalawi. These accidents lead to a high burden of morbidity \nand mortality, primarily affecting the productive age group, \nyoung men in particular, leading to socioeconomic down\u00ad\nfall on individual family and the country at large. \nWe recommend that policymakers should consider pre\u00ad\nventive measures, as the treatment of these injuries strains \nalready limited hospital resources and contributes to poor \npatient outcomes. Such preventive measures include edu\u00ad\ncational campaigns through various media, enforcement of \ntraffic rules and regulations including making sure the mo\u00ad\ntorcycle drivers undergo an appropriate training before li\u00ad\ncensure. We also recommend that the responsible authority \nshould restrict operation of motorcycle taxi (locally called \nkabaza) in busier public roads, for example, in city urbans \nwhere most of the motorcycle accidents occur as shown in \nthis study. In addition, improving safety of road infrastruc\u00ad\nture through introduction of pavements and special road \ncrossing for pedestrians in busier public roads are other im\u00ad\nportant safety measures. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis project is an output from the Global Surgery Research \nProgramme, funded by the Irish Aid for the RCSI/\nCOSECSA Collaboration Programme. \nSpecial acknowledgment goes to the following individ\u00ad\nuals for their roles to bring this research project to success: \nMs. Jennifer Msowoya, for the role of data collection \nand entry into Research Electronic Data Capture (RED\u00ad\nCap). \nMr Wongani Mtabayira Nyondo, for the role of data \nanalysis and interpretation. \nSubmitted: September 19, 2024 EAT, Accepted: Decem\u00ad\nber 23, 2024 EAT \nPatterns Of Orthopedic Injuries among Motorcycle Trauma Patients in Malawi\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n33\nReferences \n1.

Omondi, M.D\n1\na \n1\u00a0Orthopedic Unit, General Surgery, University of Nairobi \nKeywords: referral guidelines, health facility referrals, Kenyatta National Hospital \nhttps://doi.org/10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.5 \nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery \nVol. 29, Issue 4, 2024 \nAbstract \nBackground \nInappropriate utilization of higher level health facilities and ineffective management of the referral processes is characterized \nby self-referrals and frequent bypassing of nearest health facilities coupled with low formal referral mechanisms. This leads to \nunnecessary congestion at a high-cost health facility and compromises the ability and capacity of Kenyatta National Hospital \nto function as a referral facility as envisioned by Kenya Health Sector Referral Implementation Guidelines of 2014, Kenya \n201 constitution and Kenyatta National Hospital legal statue of 1987. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of \nenforcement of national referral guidelines on health facility referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital. \nMethods \nThis was a pre-post intervention test study design. The study was conducted amongst the orthopedic health facility referrals \nin 2021 with 222 and 246 before and after enforcement of the national referral guidelines respectively. This was done in \nOrthopedic Department at Kenyatta National Hospital. The variables collected were the healthy facility, location of health \nfacility, health facility tier, type of health facility (government or private) and facility related factors associated with healthy \nfacility orthopedic referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital. Data collection was done through data abstraction. Data was \nanalyzed using frequency distribution, pearson chi-square test and logistic regression. \nResults \nNairobi County and its environs constituted over four-fifth of all health facility referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital. \nEnforcement of the national referral guidelines was significant reduction in health facilities levels 2 and 3 referring patients \ndirectly to Kenyatta National Hospital after enforcement of national referral guidelines (p=0.002). About 43 health facilities \nceased referring patients to Kenyatta National Hospital with over two-thirds of these health facilities being private facilities. \nThe major facility and patient factors that were associated with health facility referrals to Kenyatta National Hospital were \nhuman resource capacity and availability and patient\u2019s preference. \nConclusion \nEnforcement of the national referral guidelines significantly reduced the lower tiers health facilities referring to Kenyatta \nNational Hospital. We recommend having written standard operating procedures on referrals based on the national referral \nguidelines with continued enforcement of the same to sustain the gains made. \nKey words: referral guidelines, health facility referrals, Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

Closing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a\ntertiary teaching and referral hospital, Kenya: pre-post intervention study design. East\nCent Afr J Surg. 2024;29(4):36-45. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v29i4.5\nBackground \nTertiary hospitals in resource-limited countries are ex\u00ad\npected to treat patients referred but in most cases are the \nfirst point of contact for the vast majority of patients.1 This \nis because of inappropriate utilization of tertiary health fa\u00ad\ncilities that results in patients\u2019 congestion in referral hospi\u00ad\ntals with simple medical conditions that can be effectively \nmanaged at the lower peripheral health facilities. The ma\u00ad\njority of these patients are self-referred, bypassing lower-\nlevel health facilities in the process.2\u20115 \nA study done in Lusaka, Malawi and in South Africa \ndemonstrated how the tertiary health facilities were con\u00ad\ngested due to bypassing of lower peripheral health facilities. \nThe urban phenomenon of widespread self-referral was as\u00ad\nsociated with low rates of formal referral from peripheral \nhealth facilities.4,6,7 The net result is overcrowding, long \nwaiting times, and scarce staff time consumed by lesser \nmedical conditions at the expense of complex medical con\u00ad\nditions. It is therefore imperative that attempts need to be \nmade to ensure patients make use of lower health facili\u00ad\nties.1,8 The bypassing of lower level health facilities also \ncripples the primary health care system and this effectively \nensures that primary health care facilities remain underused \nand inefficient.9 Taken together, this jeopardizes the appro\u00ad\npriate delivery of primary, secondary, and tertiary health \ncare. \nA cross-sectional study done to review the self-referrals \nto a District-Regional Hospital in KwaZulu Natal, South \nAfrica showed 36% were self-referrals. However, majority \n(64%) were appropriately referred with written referral let\u00ad\nters.7 \nA study on referral system in Nigeria showed that 92.9% \nreported to tertiary hospital directly without referral while \n7.1% were referred. The result of this is overcrowding of \nthe tertiary facilities with conditions that can be managed at \nlower level health facilities.8 \nKenya is a low and middle-income country. Kenya\u2019s \nhealth sector is one of the 14 functions devolved to the 47 \ncounty governments as provided for in the Fourth Sched\u00ad\nule of the 2010 constitution.10 There are 6(six) different \nlevels of health care in Kenya. Levels 1 - 5 are managed \nby the county government and level 6 by the national gov\u00ad\nernment (Figure 1). In this system patients are required to \nmove from one level to the next using a formal referral let\u00ad\nter. \nLevel 4 are Sub-County Hospitals, Nursing Homes and \nalso include medium-sized private hospitals. Level 5 are \nCounty Teaching and Referral Hospitals, large private as \nwell as faith-based hospitals. Level 6 are National Teaching \nand Referral Hospitals. In Kenya there are four teaching \nand referral hospitals: a) Mathari Hospital, b) Kenyatta Na\u00ad\ntional Hospital (KNH), c) Moi Teaching and Referral Hos\u00ad\npital and d) National Spinal Injury Hospital. These level 6 \noffer range of services similar to level 5 but additionally \nFigure 1: Six Levels of health care service delivery in \nKenya11 \nthey offer specialised treatments in addition to having ad\u00ad\nvanced infrastructure. \nKNH was established as a National Referral and Teach\u00ad\ning Hospital, to provide training and medical research in \n1901 and became a State Corporation in 1987.12 According \nto the KNH Board order of 1987 contained in the Legal \nNotice No. 109, the functions of KNH were spelled out \nas a) to receive patients on referral for specialized health \ncare; b) to provide facilities for medical education for the \nUniversity of Nairobi and other health allied courses; c) to \ncontribute to national health planning.12 This understand\u00ad\ning has been reinforced by the Kenya Health Sector Refer\u00ad\nral Implementation Guidelines, 2014, and the Constitution \nof Kenya 2010.10,13 \nOrthopaedic wards in KNH have consistently recorded \nthe highest bed occupancy percent for the last couple of \nyears. In 2018, 2019 and 2020 it recorded bed occupancy \npercent of 142.2%, 138.2% and 116.5% respectively \nagainst the KNH bed occupancy percent of 106.2%, \n113.4% and 91.5%.14 This coupled with low nurse-patient \nratio of 1:10 compromises not only the quality of nursing \ncare given to patients but also the ability of KNH to ef\u00ad\nfectively perform its statutory obligations. Various studies \nhave demonstrated that an appropriate nurse-patient ratio is \nassociated with the reduction in medical errors, decubitus \nulcers, hospital-acquired infections, long duration of hospi\u00ad\ntal stay, high readmission rates, and compromised patient \nwell-being and safety due to the nurse burnout.15\u201117 \nOn 1st July 2021, KNH management made a decision to \nenforce the Kenya Health Sector Referral Guidelines 2014. \nThis meant that patients were to be seen based on referral \nletters from other health facilities to reduce the number of \nwalk-in patients who would have otherwise been appropri\u00ad\nately seen at the peripheral health facilities. The purpose of \nthis study was to analyse the effect of enforcement of refer\u00ad\nral guidelines on orthopaedic facility referrals to KNH and \nthe associated factors. \nClosing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a tertiary teaching and referral hospita\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n37\nMethods \nStudy design \nThis was a pre-post intervention study design. The national \nreferral guideline was enforced on 1st July, 2021. The pre-\nintervention covered 5 months before enforcement of refer\u00ad\nral guidelines (February 1, to June 30, 2021) while post-\nintervention covered 5 months after enforcement of the \nreferral guidelines (August 1, to December 31, 2021). \nStudy area \nThis study was conducted in Orthopaedic Department at \nKNH. KNH is the largest teaching and referral hospital in \nEast and Central Africa. KNH Orthopaedic Wards were the \nstudy area. KNH is based in Upperhill, Nairobi, the capital \ncity of Kenya. \nStudy duration \nThe study duration was from 1st February 2021 to 31st De\u00ad\ncember 2021. The referral guidelines were enforced from \n1st July 2021. Data abstraction was conducted from 1st Jan\u00ad\nuary to 31st March, 2022. \nStudy population \nOrthopaedic admissions referred to KNH before and after \nenforcement of the national referral guidelines. \nInclusion criteria \nExclusion criteria \nSample size calculation \nSample size was calculated using an adjusted Casagrande \nformula for calculating sample sizes that compare two bi\u00ad\nnomial distributions.18 \nA sample size of 468 facility referrals were enrolled dur\u00ad\ning the study period with 220 and 248 facility referrals be\u00ad\nfore and after the enforcement of national referral guide\u00ad\nlines. \nRecruitment and sampling procedures \nThree (3) research assistants (RAs) were recruited to collect \nand abstract patient data from patient files. The RAs were \nhealth care workers with a diploma in Orthopedic Trauma \nand with some experience in research data collection. The \nPrincipal Investigator (PI) was the research coordinator for \nthe data collection. The orthopedic admissions with facility \nreferrals were identified from the a) admission desk of \nHealth Information System at KNH Accident and Emer\u00ad\ngency Unit (A&E) b) KNH Orthopedic Outpatient clinic \nrecords (OC) c) KNH Corporate Outpatient Care (COC). \nThey were then recorded in a logbook. This logbook served \nas a master register for all facility referred patients admitted \nand therefore the sampling frame for the study. All facility \nadmissions were logged into the logbook from the admis\u00ad\nsion books stationed in these three (3) services points. Prob\u00ad\nability Proportional to Size (PPS) was then used to decide \non the numbers to be sampled per month from each of these \nthree services points so that the sample size would be a rep\u00ad\nresentative of the admissions by month from each of these \nthree orthopedic admissions entry points (Table 1). \nThe three (3) RAs were reporting to and working under \nthe direction of the PI. The RAs were trained for two (2) \ndays by the PI on the research protocol, data collection \ntools, data collection procedures and that included pilot \ntesting of the data collection tools as well before the actual \ndata abstraction. \nVariables \na) Name of health facility County b) health facility location \nc) Facility Type (Government/Private) d) Health Facility \nLevel/Tier e) Admission date (dd/mm/yyyy) e) health facil\u00ad\nity related factors associated with orthopaedic referrals to \nKNH \nData collection procedures \nData collection was done through a data abstraction form \nfrom the patient files retrieved from KNH Health Records \nand Information Office. \nData Abstraction form \u2013 The three (3) RAs were trained \non the data abstraction using a data abstraction form as per \nthe research protocol. The PI reviewed all the filled-in ab\u00ad\nstraction forms for completeness and accuracy daily during \nthe entire data collection period and providing regular feed\u00ad\nback to the RAs on a timely manner to ensure data qual\u00ad\nity and compliance to the study protocol. All the completed \nand verified data abstraction forms were then collected and \nfiled by the PI at the end of every week under a lockable \ncabinet. \nEthical considerations \nThe study protocol was presented to UoN/KNH Ethics and \nResearch Committee and was granted ethical approval \n(ERC No: P852/10/2021). Administrative approval was \nalso granted by KNH Medical Research Department and \nKNH Orthopaedics Department. \n1. All orthopaedic facility referrals to KNH during the \nstudy period. \n1.

For anonymity and confidentiality pur\u00ad\nposes the data abstraction tool were marked only with the \nparticipant study numbers and no names were used. How\u00ad\never, the research assistants and the PI had access to the \npatients charts and therefore could identify individual pa\u00ad\ntients during the data collection period. The data were en\u00ad\ntered into a password-protected Redcap database kept by \nthe KNH Medical Research Department. The data were an\u00ad\nalyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Descriptive statistics such \nas frequencies while inferential statistics using Pearson\u2019s \nchi-squared tests, logistic regression were used. The calcu\u00ad\nlations were done at a 95% level of confidence. \nFindings \nBasic Profile of the sample population \nA total of 468 charts were abstracted of which 220 (47%) \nwere before and 248 (53%) were after the enforcement of \nthe referral guidelines. \nNairobi County constituted more than half of facility re\u00ad\nferrals to KNH. This rose to over four \u2013 fifths of facility re\u00ad\nferrals with inclusion of the neighbouring counties namely \nKajiado, Kiambu and Machakos. Almost all the facility re\u00ad\nferrals were from within Kenya (Table 2). \nAbout three-fifths of the facility referrals to KNH were \ngovernment health facilities with private health facilities \ncomprising about two-fifths. About half of the facility refer\u00ad\nrals are from levels 2 to 4 and with the remainder of facility \nreferrals to KNH from levels 5 and 6 (Table 2). \nClosing the gap on the referral \nsystem \nMama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital \nand Thika Level 5 Hospital were the major health facilities \nreferring patients to KNH before and after enforcement of \nthe referral guidelines (Figure 2). \nThere were increases in the health facility referrals to \nKNH after the enforcement of the referral guidelines. How\u00ad\never, these increases were not statistically significant (Table \n3). \nThere were statistically significant differences in health \nfacilities referrals to KNH before and after the enforcement \nof the referral guidelines when stratified by the health facil\u00ad\nity level (Table 4). There was significant reduction in lev\u00ad\nels 2 and 3 referring patients directly to KNH and an in\u00ad\ncrease in the facility referrals to KNH from level 4, 5 and \n6 (Table 4). There were less level 2 and 3 health facilities \nreferring patients to KNH after enforcement of the referral \nguidelines. The facility referrals from level 2 were 90.8% \nless likely as compared to level 3 after enforcement of the \nreferral guidelines (p=0.002) (Table 4). \nWhile the study showed about 43 health facilities ceased \nreferring patients to KNH with over two-thirds of these \nhealth facilities being private facilities (Table 5). \nThe study revealed that lower levels health facilities \nnamely levels 2 - 4 ceased referring patients to KNH and \nthis comprised over four-fifths of all health facilities that \nstopped referring to KNH after enforcement of the referral \nguidelines (Table 5). \nThe major facility and patient factors that were associ\u00ad\nated with facility referrals to KNH were human resource \ncapacity and availability, health facility infrastructure, Or\u00ad\nthopaedic equipment\u2019s and implants availability, patient\u2019s \npreference, financial considerations (Table 6).

This is in tandem \nwith studies done at tertiary teaching and referral health \nfacilities in Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria that \nClosing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a tertiary teaching and referral hospita\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n41\nrevealed significant majority of the facility referrals are \nfrom within the region where the health facilities are co-lo\u00ad\ncated.8,19\u201122 \nMost of the facility referrals to KNH are from govern\u00ad\nment health facilities with private health facilities compris\u00ad\ning about one-third. This compares favourably with a study \ndone in Rwanda that showed approximately 85.7% of the \nfacility referrals were from public hospitals while 10.7% of \nthe referrals were from private health facilities.23 Similarly \na prospective study done at Muhimbili National Hospital, \nTanzania to examine the medical referral pattern of patients \nin 2004, revealed that about 22.4% of admissions were from \npublic health facilities while only 4.2% were from private \nhealth facilities.24 \nMama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital \nand Thika Level 5 Hospital were the major health facilities \nreferring patients to KNH before and after enforcement of \nthe referral guidelines and they all happen to be government \nhealth facilities \u2013 which comprise majority of health facil\u00ad\nity referrals to KNH as compared to private health facility \nreferrals. This is probably because of inadequate human re\u00ad\nsource, inadequate infrastructure like bed capacity, theatre \nspace as well as lack of orthopaedic equipments and im\u00ad\nplants. However, this contrasts with a study on referrals to \na tertiary health facility in Nigeria that showed over half of \nthe admissions were from private health facilities.8 In addi\u00ad\ntion, St Peters Orthopaedic and Surgical Speciality Centre, \nSt Francis Community Hospital, Arthi River Shalom Com\u00ad\nmunity Hospital and St Mary\u2019s Mission Hospital were the \nmost frequently referring private health facilities to KNH \nfor orthopaedic admissions in 2021. These were probably \ndue to inadequate human capacity, patients\u2019 preference and \nfinancial considerations. \nThere were increases in the number of health facilities \nreferring patients to KNH after the enforcement of the re\u00ad\nferral guidelines. This is in tandem with a study done in \nRepublic of Hondura that showed the referral rate was ob\u00ad\nserved to be higher when institutional managers empha\u00ad\nsized the importance of the referral system.4 The enforce\u00ad\nment of the national referral guidelines meant more \nawareness on the referral requirements and importance of \nreferrals of patients to the next level of care and this might \nhave resulted in increase in the number of health facilities \nreferring patients. \nThe enforcement of the national referral guidelines was \nmeant to streamline the referral process from the peripheral \nhealth facilities to KNH and in the process allow KNH \nto manage complex orthopaedic cases that cannot be han\u00ad\ndled at the lower-level health facilities. All potential refer\u00ad\nring health facilities were required to refer patients to the \nnext level of health facility instead of referring directly to \nKNH and the higher level health facilities were expected to \nseek concurrence before referring patients to KNH and that \nshould be accompanied with an official referring letter. Due \nto the enforcement of these referral requirements, there was \nsignificant reduction in lower levels 2 and 3 health facilities \nreferring patients directly to KNH and an increase in the pa\u00ad\ntients being referred to KNH from levels 4, 5 and 6. \nThe study showed about 43 health facilities ceased re\u00ad\nferring patients to directly to KNH with over two-thirds of \nthese health facilities being private facilities. This is in tan\u00ad\ndem with a study on Geographic accessibility to public and \nprivate health facilities done in Kenya in 2021 that revealed \nthe private health facilities\u2019 distribution was skewed toward \nthe urban counties.25 The implication of this is that a good \nnumber of private health facilities were no longer referred \npatients directly to KNH. \nLower levels health facilities namely levels 2 and 3 \nlargely reduced patient referrals to KNH and this together \nwith level 4 comprised over four-fifths of all health facili\u00ad\nties that stopped referring to KNH after enforcement of the \nreferral guidelines. This is because these lower-level health \nfacilities were now required to refer patients to the near\u00ad\nest level 4 and 5 health facilities as their first referral point. \nThis means that the enforcement of the national referral \nguidelines did reduce referrals from lower level health fa\u00ad\ncilities and probably were referring them to the next tier fa\u00ad\ncility. This may explain why the numbers of higher levels \nreferring patients to KNH increased after the enforcement \nof the referral guidelines. \nHuman resource capacity remains a major factor in \nhealth facility referrals both for private and government \nhealth facilities. Inadequate human resource does also com\u00ad\nprise the quality of care provided at the health facilities. \nThis is in tandem with a study finding in Kenya that re\u00ad\nvealed Human resources for health was inadequately fi\u00ad\nnanced with insufficient number of health workers and \nthere was maldistribution of staff in favor of higher-level \nfacilities and in urban cities and this resulted in unnecessary \nreferrals to higher level consequently compromised quality \nof primary healthcare.26\u201128 A number of studies in Brazil, \nJapan, United States of America and in Low- and Middle-\nincome countries have also demonstrated inadequate hu\u00ad\nman resource capacity and availability as the main reasons \nfor patient referrals.29\u201133 However, this contradicts a study \ndone in China on types of health care facilities and the qual\u00ad\nity of primary care revealed that Community Health Cen\u00ad\nters offer quality health care services than the secondary \nand tertiary health care hospitals.34 This was largely due to \nthe fact that it was Chinese deliberate government policy to \nsupport and improve the capacity of the Community Health \nCenters. \nPrivate health facility referrals to KNH were to a signif\u00ad\nicant extent dictated by patients\u2019 preference. This could be \ndue to perceived good quality of care but also due to per\u00ad\nceived low cost of medical care in KNH by virtue of it be\u00ad\ning a government national referral hospital. Studies done in \nCalifornia, USA and Islamic Republic of Iran, Cape Town, \nSouth Africa did show that the perception of good quality \nof care does influence choice of health facility.3,35\u201137 \nThe study had a few limitations.

This was mitigated by en\u00ad\nsuring the data collection period covered the covid period \nwhere intercounty movement restrictions were lifted. Sec\u00ad\nondly, this study is retrospective and a quasi-experimental \nstudy design and hence weaker in determining causality. \nDespite these limitations, given the paucity of published lit\u00ad\nerature in this study topic, this study offers key information \non the effects of enforcement of referral guidelines in health \nfacility referrals to KNH with important lessons for Kenya \nand similar settings in sub-Saharan Africa. \nConclusions \nThe enforcement of the national referral guidelines did re\u00ad\nduce the number of facility referrals from lower level health \nfacilities with a good number of private health facilities \nstopped referring patients to KNH altogether. The major fa\u00ad\ncility and patient factors that were associated with facility \nreferrals to KNH were human resource capacity and avail\u00ad\nability, health facility infrastructure, Orthopaedic equip\u00ad\nment\u2019s and implants availability, patient\u2019s preference, fi\u00ad\nnancial considerations. Therefore, it is possible to \nsuccessfully enforce the implementation of referral guide\u00ad\nlines. \nRecommendations \nRecommendations to Policy Makers/ \nCounty Government \nRecommendations to KNH \nRecommendations to Health Facilities \n1. Regularly sensitize the health facilities on the imple\u00ad\nmentation of the national referral guidelines 2014 for \ncontinued enforcement of the referral guidelines; \n2. Strengthen the human resource capacity and avail\u00ad\nability to minimize on referrals to KNH and this will \nconsequently strengthen the primary and tertiary level \northopaedic and trauma care and help decongest \nKNH and allow it to function as a premier referral fa\u00ad\ncility as per its statutory obligations; \n3. Develop, disseminate and train health facilities on \nstandard operating procedures based on the national \nreferral guidelines and ensure adherence to the same. \n1. Educate and sensitize the health facilities on the role \nof KNH as a premier National Teaching and Referral \nfacility that is mandated to manage complex referrals \nand should not be the first point of contact for patients \nseeking orthopaedic care; \n2. Develop, disseminate and train KNH staff from A&E \ndepartment, Orthopedic Clinic and Corporate Outpa\u00ad\ntient Centre on the national referral guidelines and re\u00ad\nferral standard operating procedures. \n1. Ensure adherence to the national referral guidelines \nof 2014 for an effective referral process and to en\u00ad\nsure optimum utilization of primary, secondary and \ntertiary level of care. \nSubmitted: June 10, 2024 EAT, Accepted: December 17, \n2024 EAT \nClosing the gap towards a successful referral system, a case study of a tertiary teaching and referral hospita\u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n43\nReferences \n1.

A gangrenous transverse colon in a congenital \ndiaphragmatic hernia is even rarer in adults. The study aims to demonstrate a gangrenous colon in congenital diaphragmatic \nhernia at 23 years. \nThe patient presented with features of intestinal obstruction and respiratory distress. The chest radiograph indicated a large \nbowel in the left chest cavity. CT scan of the chest confirmed a diaphragmatic hernia with its complications. The histological \ndiagnosis was gangrenous colon in keeping with strangulated hernia. At laparotomy, a left diaphragmatic defect of 4-5 cm \nand a gangrenous transverse colon in the left chest cavity were found. The gangrenous colon was resected and created \na transverse colostomy. A left thoracostomy tube was inserted. After 3 months the colostomy reversal was done and the \nrecovery was uneventful. \nThe report demonstrated a rare case of gangrenous colon in a congenital diaphragmatic hernia at 23 years managed by \nsurgery via an abdominal approach. \nIntroduction \nA diaphragmatic hernia (DH) is a congenital or acquired di\u00ad\naphragm defect that allows intra-abdominal viscera to nav\u00ad\nigate into the chest cavity.1,2 DH is classified into postero\u00ad\nlateral, anterior, or central with the posterolateral hernia \n(Bochdalek hernia) being the commonest congenital DH ( \n95 %).1,3,4 Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) arises \nfrom the failed fusion of the diaphragmatic embryonical \ncomponent (around 8 weeks of gestation) with resultant ab\u00ad\nnormal lung development.5 Congenital DH is common in \nneonates with an incidence of 0.8\u20135/10,000 live births.1,4,6 \nAmong adults, CDH is rare and usually incidental.4 Ar\u00ad\nguably, the prevalence could be as high as 20% even though \nmostly asymptomatic.3 Furthermore, acquired diaphrag\u00ad\nmatic hernias are rare and due to trauma (<1% of all \ntrauma).6 Its rate increases to three percent in abdominal \ninjuries.6 DH is more common in males.7 DH risks incar\u00ad\ncerating and strangulating abdominal viscera.6 Complicated \nDH is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 31%.6 \nThe symptomatic cases present with nonspecific abdom\u00ad\ninal and respiratory complaints. However, pain is the most \ncommon symptom (69%).4,6,7 \nBesides the clinical assessment, several modalities exist \nto diagnose DH. They include chest radiographs, barium \nstudies, Computer Tomography (CT) scans, and Magnet \nResonance Imaging (MRI). However, the CT scan is the \nmost preferred modality as it confirms the diagnosis and de\u00ad\ntects herniated contents and complications.2,5 \nDH is managed by surgery either via laparotomy (com\u00ad\nmonest), or laparoscopic approach.6,7 Operative approach \nis influenced by the patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability, as\u00ad\nsociated conditions, and the surgeon\u2019s expertise.6 Patients \nwho present with features of incarceration, gangrene, or \nperforation of hernia content warrant emergency surgery.5 \nThe abdominal approach remains the most preferred \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

Depending on the size of the de\u00ad\nfect, diaphragmatic hernia can be primarily repaired with \nsutures or tension-free mesh.6 \nThe case report aims to demonstrate a gangrenous colon \nin a congenital diaphragmatic hernia at 23 years. \nCase presentation \nA male 23 years old presented with abdominal pain, disten\u00ad\nsion, vomiting fecal matter, and constipation. He had diffi\u00ad\nculties breathing. There was no history of thoracoabdomi\u00ad\nnal trauma or surgery. The drug history was unremarkable \nand a cattle herder who never smoked or consumed alcohol. \nOn examination, BP 120/76mmhg, P-120bpm, Sat 84% \nroom air and 96% on oxygen. Temp 37.5 degrees Celsius, \nrespiratory rate 24. The patient was fully conscious and \nhad dry mucous membranes. There was neither pallor nor \njaundice. Chest examination revealed reduced air entry and \ndullness on the left side. A cardiovascular exam revealed \nheart sounds in the right hemithorax. The abdomen revealed \nepigastric fullness, tenderness, and guarding. The digital \nrectal exam was non-revealing. \nThe laboratory revealed hemoglobin of 15.00g/dl, leuco\u00ad\ncytosis (WCC 27.01x10^9/L), neutrophilia 83.1%, and ele\u00ad\nvated C-reactive protein CRP 474.5mg/l. The biochemistry \nrevealed potassium of 3.9 mmol/L, sodium of 141 mmol/\nL, elevated urea of 16.6 mmol/L, creatinine (150 \u00b5mol/L), \nhypoalbuminemia of 32 with elevated bilirubin of 61umol/\nl, alkaline phosphates 152U/l and normal transaminases. \nThe chest /X-ray showed left pleural effusion and shift\u00ad\ning of the mediastinum to the right side (Figure 1). The ab\u00ad\ndominal X-ray revealed a distended loop of large bowel in \nthe left and right upper quadrants (Figure 2). The CT scan \nof the chest confirmed herniation of the colon into the left \nchest cavity, mediastinal shift to the right, pleural effusion \nand significant compression of the left lung (Figure 3). \nOnce the diagnosis was made, intravenous (IV) fluid re\u00ad\nsuscitation, administered IV antibiotics ceftriaxone 1g BD \n5/7 and metronidazole 500mg TDS 5/7, kept the patient \nnil per mouth, inserted a nasogastric tube, catheterized, \nand consented to emergency laparotomy. In the emmer\u00ad\ngency room, a left thoracostomy tube was inserted for left \npleural effusion (serosanguinous fluid). At laparotomy, a \nleft diaphragmatic defect of 4 to 5cm (Figure 4) and a \ngangrenous transverse colon in the left chest cavity were \nfound (Figure 5). The gangrenous part of the transverse \ncolon was resected and created a temporary transverse end \ncolostomy (Figure 6) while the distal descending colon \nstump was closed. Peritoneal and chest lavage was with co\u00ad\npious amounts of warm saline. The histological diagnosis \nwas gangrenous colon in keeping with strangulated hernia. \nAfter 3 months, reversal of transverse end colostomy was \nFigure 1.

A diaphragmatic hernia at \n23 years old is a rare entity and the Bochdalek hernia re\u00ad\nmains the most common in 70 to 95% of cases.5,8 Even \nthough common in neonates, it could be due to blunt or pen\u00ad\netrating thoracoabdominal trauma in adults.2 Nonetheless, \nour patient did not have a history of trauma. \nIn a systematic review of 192 cases of left-sided CDH, \nthere was a male predominance (50.5% males) with a mean \nage of 45.41\u2009\u00b1\u200920.26\u2009years.8 Generally, CDH is more com\u00ad\nmon in males and other studies support our finding.2 In con\u00ad\ntrast, CDH in female adult has been documented.9\u201111 Fur\u00ad\nthermore, CDH are more on the left side due to protective \neffect of the liver and earlier closure of the pleuroperitoneal \ncanal on the right diaphragm.9,10 \nIn adults, it is diagnosed incidentally in radiological \nstudies for other medical conditions.2,4,12 The patient could \nremain asymptomatic for years until the herniated abdom\u00ad\nFigure 4.

Transverse colostomy creation \nFigure 7. The healing abdominal wounds after \nreversal of the colostomy \ninal contents compress the lungs causing respiratory dis\u00ad\ntress.2,9 For the symptomatic cases, they present with \nvague, non-specific chest or abdominal complaints or as an \nemergency with strangulation, stomach perforation, colonic \nnecrosis/perforation, or a tension pneumothorax.4,6,10 Fea\u00ad\ntures of adult CDH include shortness of breath, food in\u00ad\ntolerance, gastroesophageal reflux, nausea, vomiting, ab\u00ad\ndominal cramping, distension, and abdominal pain.2,7 In \na review of 173 cases and 192 cases of adult CDH, pain \nwas the most common complaint in 69% and 62%, respec\u00ad\ntively.7,8 In our case, the patient presented with respiratory \nand abdominal complaints and strangulated hernia. \nThe CT scan is the gold standard and established the \ndiagnosis of DH in 89% of cases.5,11 However, the diag\u00ad\nnosis could be made clinically, using chest radiographs, \nbarium studies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).2,\n5 Chest radiograph might show herniated abdominal vis\u00ad\ncera.2,10 A gastric air bubble in the chest cavity for herni\u00ad\nated stomach or air-fluid level for pleural effusion.2,11 In \nour case, the chest radiograph indicated a large bowel in the \nleft chest cavity while the CT scan confirmed the diagnosis \nof left diaphragmatic hernia, the herniated colon, and left \npleural effusion.2,5 Several cases document that herniated \nabdominal viscera include the stomach, omentum, small \nand large bowel, appendix, mesentery, liver, gall bladder, \nkidney, spleen, and pancreas with the colon being the most \ncommon (52%).5,6,8\u201110,12 \nSurgery is the treatment of choice although a conserv\u00ad\native approach has been documented.5 Surgery via the ab\u00ad\ndominal approach is the most common approach for sur\u00ad\ngical repair, including thoracic or thoracoabdominal \napproaches.2,5,6 Surgery either via laparotomy (common\u00ad\nest), laparoscopic, or combined laparoscopic-thoracoscopic \napproach, thoracotomy.6,7 Also, a robotic-assisted ap\u00ad\nproach has been documented.5 Laparoscopic surgery bene\u00ad\nfits low complication rates and short hospital stay7 Opera\u00ad\ntive approach is influenced by the patient\u2019s hemodynamic \nstability, associated conditions, and the surgeon\u2019s exper\u00ad\ntise.6 Patients who present with features of incarceration, \ngangrene, or perforation of hernia content warrant emer\u00ad\ngency surgery.5,9 A laparotomy allows the surgeon to as\u00ad\nsess the viability of herniated contents, and manage ab\u00ad\ndominal visceral complications (gangrene, perforation, and \ncontamination).5,9,10 On the contrary, it offers limited ac\u00ad\ncess to the chest cavity. Arguably the thoracoabdominal ap\u00ad\nproach enables evaluation and adequate surgical treatment \nof both cavities.5 \nThe principles of surgery in DH are to identify the hernia \ndefect, reduce the contents, and repair the diaphragm.6 In \nthis case, we repaired the diaphragm with absorbable suture \nvicryl and did not place a mesh due to the significant conta\u00ad\nmination. Depending on the size of the defect, it can be pri\u00ad\nmarily repaired with sutures (absorbable or non-absorbable \n65%) or tension-free mesh absorbable or nonabsorbable \nmesh (68%).5,6,9,10 \nDH risks abdominal and thoracic complications includ\u00ad\ning hydronephrosis, abscess formation, lung empyema, \nbroncho-pleuro-colonic fistula, pleural effusion, fecotho\u00ad\nrax, and pneumonia5\u2003 Complications could be hernia-re\u00ad\nlated or surgery-related bowel ischemia, gangrene, bowel \nperforation, sepsis, and wound infection.2,5 In a systematic \nreview of 193 patients with adult CDH, the 30-day mortal\u00ad\nity was 4.4% while the postoperative complication rate was \n21.5%.8 \nGangrenous Colon in a Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia at 23 years: A Case Report\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n7\nBeing a single retrospective case report limits its gen\u00ad\neralizability.

A rapid and \naccurate diagnosis is vital and surgical repair is mandatory \nfor strangulated diaphragmatic hernia.

Optimal management of PPSS is not fully defined though complete \nresection is generally considered a key component of treatment. Here we report the surgical approach to an unusual PPSS \nbridging the upper retroperitoneum and lower posterior mediastinum and discuss care in the context of the published \nliterature. \nINTRODUCTION \nSynovial sarcomas (SS) account for almost 10% of all soft \ntissue sarcomas and typically arise in the para-articular re\u00ad\ngions, but actually has been shown to have no biologic or \npathologic relationship to synovium. A subtype, primary \npleural synovial sarcoma (PPSS),which is thought to arise \nfrom the pleura is idiopathic and extremely rare. PPSS is a \nlocally aggressive tumor, seen most frequently in patients \nover age 40 years, compared to other SS which more com\u00ad\nmonly occur in adolescents and young adults.1 The diagno\u00ad\nsis of PPSS is made after excluding metastasis from an ex\u00ad\ntra-thoracic site. \nWe report the case of a patient who presented with a \nmass bridging the upper retroperitoneum and lower poste\u00ad\nrior mediastinum and involving the adjacent pleura. We dis\u00ad\ncuss the surgical approach and management of this unusual \ncase within the context of the published literature. Written \ninformed consent was obtained from the patient for publi\u00ad\ncation of this case report and accompanying images. \nCASE SUMMARY \nA 55-year-old female patient had repeated visits to an out\u00ad\nside hospital over six months with complaints of lower back \npain and abdominal fullness. She denied dysphagia and \nweight loss. She had no other significant medical or sur\u00ad\ngical history. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a \npossible distal esophageal tumor. She was referred to our \nhospital for consideration of surgical resection. \nOn physical examination, the patient was in no acute dis\u00ad\ntress, had normal vital signs and no appreciable abdominal \nmass or tenderness. Hematologic profile, electrolytes, liver, \nand renal function tests were normal. Contrast CT of the \nchest and upper abdomen revealed a 7 cm x 5.5 cm x 4.5 cm \nwell circumscribed lower mediastinal and upper retroperi\u00ad\ntoneal soft tissue mass with internal calcifications either ad\u00ad\njacent to or arising from the distal esophagus (Figures 1a \nand 1b). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) was un\u00ad\nremarkable. \nBased on the clinical presentation, relatively indolent \ncourse and CT findings, the presumptive preoperative di\u00ad\nagnoses were paraganglioma or gastrointestinal stromal tu\u00ad\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License \n(CCBY-4.0).

Following multidisciplinary discussions with \nour radiologists, percutaneous needle biopsy for diagnosis \nwas not considered technically feasible. There is also no ac\u00ad\ncess currently to esophageal ultrasound guided biopsies at \nour hospital so it was decided to proceed directly to surgical \nexploration and resection. \nSurgical Approach \nAfter placing an epidural catheter, general anesthesia was \ninduced and the patient was placed in the partial left lateral \nFigure 2a. Intraoperative findings at the beginning \nof the dissection. The gastroesophageal junction \n(solid black arrow) has been retracted to the \npatient\u2019s left, and the left lobe of the liver (black \ndotted arrow) to the patient\u2019s right, exposing the \ninferior vena cava and the hepatic veins. The \ndiaphragm (blue block arrow) has been incised and \nretracted to expose the mediastinal component of \nthe tumor. \ndecubitus position (right side elevated approximately 30 de\u00ad\ngrees), a right thoracoabdominal incision was made. The \nright 9th intercostal space was entered, the costal margin di\u00ad\nvided, and the incision extended in the midline of the upper \nabdomen to the level of the umbilicus. The right lung was \ndeflated and the right pleural space entered. The diaphragm \nwas incised parallel and close to the costal margin to access \nthe peritoneal cavity. Thus there was adequate exposure of \nthe gastroesophageal junction, hepatic veins, inferior vena \ncava and inferior aspect of the pulmonary hilum. \nIntraoperative findings \nThe mass was well circumscribed with moderate peritu\u00ad\nmoral fibrosis, and was located in the posterior medi\u00ad\nastinum and upper retroperitoneum with adhesion to the \nright crus of the diaphragm, and adhesion and leftward dis\u00ad\nplacement of the distal thoracic and abdominal esophagus. \nIt abutted the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava. There \nwas no evidence of invasion of the esophagus, proximal \nstomach, liver, thoracic or lumbar vertebrae (Figures 2a and \n2b). There were no intra-thoracic or peritoneal metastases. \nThe right pleura was widely opened, the inferior pul\u00ad\nmonary ligament divided, the lung retracted superiorly, and \nthe diaphragmatic incision extended to expose the intra- ab\u00ad\ndominal component of the mass. The lower thoracic esoph\u00ad\nagus above the tumor was encircled and retracted towards \nManagement of a Synovial Sarcoma at The Level of The Diaphragmatic Hiatus: A Case Report\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n11\nFigure 2b.

The incision \nwas closed in the standard manner with interrupted non-ab\u00ad\nsorbable horizontal mattress sutures to reapproximate the \ndiaphragm, and closure in layers of the thoracic and abdom\u00ad\ninal components of the incision. \nPathology findings \nGrossly, the tumor measured 7x6x3cm, appeared solid and \nencapsulated (Figure 3a). Histologic examination (by \nhematoxylin and eosin staining) showed a high-grade sar\u00ad\ncoma consistent with biphasic synovial sarcoma. Micro\u00ad\nscopic evaluation showed solid proliferation of plump spin\u00ad\ndle cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and variable sized \nnests of glands lined by columnar cells, some glands con\u00ad\ntaining eosinophilic secretions with areas of necrosis and \ncalcification (Figures 3b and 3c). Genomic testing was not \navailable in our hospital (or elsewhere in Ethiopia) for fur\u00ad\nther confirmation of the histologic diagnosis or the fusion \nsubtype. \nPostoperative course \nThe patient was admitted to the ICU for the first 24 hours, \nthen transferred to the ward for routine postoperative care. \nShe developed a superficial surgical site infection on third \npost-operative day and culture showed coagulase-negative \nstaphylococcus. She was started on a 7-day course of ap\u00ad\npropriate antibiotics and local wet to dry wound care. Chest \ntube was removed after 5 days and the patient discharged \nFigure 3a.

Although we cannot be certain of the \nexact site of origin in our patient since the tumor involved \nthe pleura, the mediastinum and upper retroperitoneum, it \nis probably most consistent with primary pleural SS (PPSS) \nwhich is an extremely rare tumor. The absence of extra-tho\u00ad\nracic disease should be confirmed before the diagnosis of \nPPSS is made since SS, like other soft tissue sarcomas, tend \nto metastasize to the pleura and lung.4\u20117 \nThe clinical symptoms of PPSS vary widely, mainly \nbased on the histology and region of the tumor occurrence, \nas well as the size and degree of tumor differentiation.8 Ini\u00ad\ntially, the patient may be asymptomatic but as the disease \nprogresses, patients may present with non-specific pul\u00ad\nmonary symptoms such as chest pain, cough, or dyspnea. \nIn the current case, symptoms were predominantly abdom\u00ad\ninal due to the location of the tumor in the thoracoabdomi\u00ad\nnal junction. The radiologic manifestations of PPSS overlap \nwith many other neoplasms in the lung and pleura,9 in\u00ad\ncluding primary and metastatic lung cancer, solitary fibrous \ntumor of the pleura and other rare parenchymal sarcomas \n(e.g., leiomyosarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and malig\u00ad\nnant fibrous histiocytoma).9\u201111 In the present case, paragan\u00ad\nglioma and primary esophageal tumor (i.e. leiomyoma or \nGIST) were the top diagnoses based on preoperative radio\u00ad\nlogic findings and endoscopy. \nPPSS share the histologic, and immunohistochemical \nfeatures of SS arising in other locations6,12 appearing as \nmonophasic, biphasic, or poorly differentiated tumors. The \ntwo most common subtypes are monophasic spindle and \nbiphasic.8 The unique fusion gene, SYT-SSX, generated \nby a specific chromosomal translocation t(x;18) (p11: q11) \nwhich fuses parts of chromosome 18 and the X chromo\u00ad\nsome. This has been detected in more than 95% of SS and \ncurrently represents the most specific evidence for defin\u00ad\nitive diagnosis. Additionally, this chromosomal transloca\u00ad\ntion is now known to have two subtypes, commonly re\u00ad\nferred to SSX1 and SSX2. The SSX1 fusion is known to \nhave a higher proliferation rate and poorer clinical out\u00ad\ncomes.13 Fusion gene detection is increasingly being con\u00ad\nsidered indispensable, with SS18 break-apart fluorescence \nin situ hybridization (FISH) being favored in many labo\u00ad\nratories.14,15 Unfortunately, we do not have access to ge\u00ad\nnomic testing at either our hospital or in Ethiopia. \nPPSS appears to be more aggressive than SS arising in \nextremities with most patients dying within 1\u20133 years.4,11,\n16 Because of its rarity, the optimal treatment for PPSS re\u00ad\nmains unclear. Complete resection is considered the best \noption. Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and \neven neoadjuvant therapy have been used but again, due \nto the rarity of this tumor subset, definitive data are lack\u00ad\ning.1,17 Repeat resections have been performed for local re\u00ad\ncurrence and sequenced resections are reported for cases \nin which the tumor could not be completely resected in a \nsingle operation.18 Fortunately, we were able to achieve a \ncomplete tumor resection in our patient but her follow-up is \ncurrently short and her prognosis uncertain. Longer follow-\nup with serial chest and abdominal CT imaging is essential. \nCONCLUSION \nPPSS is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that is difficult to con\u00ad\nfirm based on imaging, but should be considered in the dif\u00ad\nferential diagnosis of pleural based thoracic tumors without \nextra thoracic sites of disease or regional lymphadenopathy. \nThe benefit of adjuvant therapy following complete resec\u00ad\ntion is uncertain but careful long-term follow-up is essential \ngiven the propensity of these tumors to recur.4,11,12,16 \nConflict of interest \nAll authors declare no conflicts of interest \nInformed consent \nWe obtained verbal and written informed consent with local \nlanguage (Amharic) from the patient for surgical interven\u00ad\ntion as well as willingness to be reported for publication. \nSubmitted: October 01, 2024 EAT.

There is little known about what type of surgical procedures are done in the district hospitals and which carder operates \non what type of cases. Zambia formulated the national surgical, obstetrics, and anaesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) in 2017 which is \na strategic plan aimed at improving surgical services in order to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). \nMethods \nWe conducted an analytical study on the surgical services available in the six major districts, across the province as \nwe conducted surgical camps. We booked patients before the scheduled surgical camps through radio announcements \nand other established channels. We analyzed the local booking lists and theatre records, assessed the surgical services, \naccessibility and interviewed the local teams on the challenges being faced. \nResults \nThere were no booking lists in all facilities. 68% of cases done in the district hospitals are caesarian sections with very few \nother surgical cases. We conducted 219 cases, 63% elective cases and 37% emergency cases of which 53% were obstetric \ncases. The majority of elective cases were excisions at 40% and hernias were 35%. The lack of human resource was the \nnumber one reason why basic surgical procedures were not being done followed by lack of supply of medical and surgical \nsupplies. \nConclusion \nThere is very little surgery that happens in the district hospitals, apart from caesarian sections which exhaust the operating \nteams in the facilities. The lack of staff, medical equipment, and poor medical - surgical supplies are the top challenges \nadvanced. There is a lot of work to be done as we thrive to achieve UHC in the Eastern region of Zambia. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reports that Five \nbillion people globally lack access to surgical care, result\u00ad\ning in 18 million annual deaths and accounting for one-third \nof the global disease burden. In response, the WHO and \nits member states recognized surgical and anesthesia care \nas essential to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in 2015.1 \nThe Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) in\u00ad\ntroduced the National Surgical, Obstetrics and Anesthesia \nPlans (NSOAPs) framework to guide countries in devel\u00ad\noping strategic plans for surgical systems. This framework \nhas supported several low and middle-income countries \n(Zambia included) in strengthening emergency and essen\u00ad\ntial surgical services as part of Universal Health Coverage \n(UHC) implementation.2 Defining essential surgical ser\u00ad\nvices is crucial for countries to provide comprehensive \nhealthcare. NSOAPs play a vital role in integrating emer\u00ad\ngency and essential surgical care with other health services \nto achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) goals.

Challenges of Providing Surgical Care in\nEastern Zambia. East Cent Afr J Surg. 2025;30(1):15-20. doi:10.4314/ecajs.v30i1.4\nbia was a pioneer in formulating NSOAPs in 2017, but \nimplementation has been a significant challenge.3 Surgical \ncare in Africa is predominantly centered in urban referral \nhospitals, leaving rural areas with limited access to quality \nsurgical services. This disparity stems from a number of \nreasons including, Urban hospitals attract specialists due to \nbetter facilities, training opportunities, and living standards. \nHospitals in cities have superior infrastructure, equipment, \nand resources. This has affected the rural hospitals nega\u00ad\ntively that it is difficulty to have access to essential surgi\u00ad\ncal care in these remote areas.4 In several countries, district \nhospital-level surgery is almost exclusively provided by \nnon-physician clinicians (NPCs), also called clinical offi\u00ad\ncers, associate clinicians, or assistant medical officers. This \nis called \u2018task shifting\u2019.5 Compared to medical doctors, the \nduration of surgical training for NPCs is shorter (typically \n2 to 3 years), with lower training costs and better reten\u00ad\ntion rates. The term task-shifting applies, which the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) defines as \u2018the rational redis\u00ad\ntribution of tasks from highly qualified workers to health \nworkers with shorter training and fewer qualifications\u2019.6 In \nthe case of surgery, it involves the delegation of surgical \ntasks from surgical specialists or general medical doctors \n(MDs) to surgically trained NCPs. The contribution to sur\u00ad\ngical care by the NCPs is often considered as a substitute \nfor medically qualified professionals and concerns around \nthe safety of surgical \u2018task shifting\u2019 solutions have been \nexpressed. Research by Gajewski et al. found that NCPs \nin rural hospitals achieved comparable patient outcomes to \nmedically qualified professionals measured by wound in\u00ad\nfections and surgical mortality. This study addresses con\u00ad\ncerns about \u2018task shifting\u2019 safety, suggesting that NCPs can \neffectively bridge the surgical workforce gap in the rural ar\u00ad\neas.7 \nIt is known that even small facilities can deliver effec\u00ad\ntive basic essential surgical services with careful utilization \nof the existing healthcare delivery structures already in use \nthat can be leveraged to provide affordable and quality sur\u00ad\ngical care.8 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nWe conducted surgical camps across six districts at their \nhospitals. The local teams were informed at least two \nmonths before camp time. The communities were informed \nthrough radio announcements, posters, and messengers to \nclinics. The clinic staff then were made to spread the invi\u00ad\ntations to their catchment areas through community-based \nvolunteers to the specific Neighborhood Health Commit\u00ad\ntees (NHCs). The communities were asked to present them\u00ad\nselves to the local facilities with all kinds of surgical dis\u00ad\neases on the specified surgical camp dates. Patients who \npresented earlier than the surgical camp dates were accord\u00ad\ningly booked for the camps. \nAll the camps had at least a Surgeon, a trainee Surgeon \n(or theatre nurse), and an anesthesia provider. The camps \nlasted on average five days with the daily work schedule \nof conducting ward rounds, outpatient screening, perform\u00ad\ning surgical procedures with the local teams, attending to \nall emergencies and holding clinical meetings. We looked \nat the booking lists and operation records for one-month \nperiod. Key members of staff (theatre nurses, anesthesia \nproviders, medical licentiates, and Doctors) were inter\u00ad\nviewed using a google sheet designed questionnaire. We \npicked August of 2021 to analyze the type of operations \ndone in the facilities as most of the citizens in region are \nfarmers and it is assumed that by August, most of them \nwould have less commitment to fieldwork and they would \neasily seek medical attention. This was also before the an\u00ad\nnouncement of the surgical camps. \nAll patients who were seen during the camps by the sur\u00ad\ngical teams were recorded. Patients found with surgical dis\u00ad\neases and fit for theatre were booked. We noted those who \ndenied consent due to different reasons and those we re\u00ad\nferred for specialized investigations. \nRESULTS \nAnalysis of records \nNo facility had booking lists for elective operations apart \nfrom those booked for the camps. The analyzed records re\u00ad\nviewed a total of 299 operations done in the selected six \nhospitals. The majority of these operations were caesar\u00ad\nian sections, at 68% followed by fracture manipulations \nat 13%. Hernia repairs were only done in one hospital, \nat 4% meanwhile exploratory laparotomies and excisions \nwere both at 3%. See Figure 1. \nSurgical camps \nFor our surgical camps, we screened 700 patients in total \nand operated on 219 different cases (Table 1). A majority \nof the patients (61%) operated on were over the age of 20 \nyears (40% 20-39, 21% >40) with only 81 (39%) being \n<20. Those operated on were mostly males (57%) while \nfemales constituted 43%. Most cases for our camps were \nbooked cases, about 65%. The majority of the emergency \ncases were obstetrics in nature (caesarian sections and post-\nabortal vacuum aspirations) at 53%. Of the elective cases, \nwe had about 40% cases of inguinal hernia and 37% were \nlamps and bumps for excisions, Figures 2 and 3 have more \ndetails. Of note, 110 patients with clear surgical cases were \nnot operated. Most of them did not show up (52%) due \nto their field/farm engagements or otherwise and 35% did \nnot give consent while the rest (13%) were referred. A few \nwere not operated due to a lack of basic investigations. \nChallenges of Providing Surgical Care in Eastern Zambia\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n16\nFigure 1.

Ten barriers to \nsurgery were given, as outlined in Table 2. Exhausted oper\u00ad\nating teams, unavailability of staff (Doctors and anesthesia \nproviders), lack of surgical supplies and a lack of expertise \nwere some of the most advanced challenges. \nDISCUSSION \nAll anesthesia providers in the district hospitals are NCPs, \nmostly are former clinical officers or nurses. There is at \nleast a medical licentiate (MLs) and medical officer (MO) \nat every facility. Not all theatres are run by trained theatre \nnurses. These are the cadres who do operations in the dis\u00ad\ntrict hospitals with special emphasis on emergency obstetric \ncases. There are frequent refresher courses and mentorship \nprograms for obstetric case management for these teams, \nbut none of such programs are available for general surgical \ncases. Task shifting is very much being practiced but \nmostly on maternal and child health.9 Some facilities have \nno anesthesia providers and where available, it is only one \nprovider per facility. The MOs and MLs have been made to \ngive anesthesia in instances of unavailability of the anesthe\u00ad\nsia providers. This practice though risky, has been proven to \nbe safe in resource limited settings.10 There is an imminent \nneed to increase the numbers of all these cadres in the fa\u00ad\ncilities across the region and frequent mentorships on other \nsurgical conditions are also needed to improve care.11 \nThe district hospitals by and large do obstetric opera\u00ad\ntions, caesarian sections, and post abortal care, at 68%. As \nindicated by many authors12 and,13 obstetric emergencies \nare the main type of operations done in the District hospi\u00ad\ntals. The local teams are left exhausted by these cases and \nunable to go on with other surgical operations. During the \nstudy, fractures were the second leading emergency. In the \nEastern province of Zambia, the simple fractures are man\u00ad\nChallenges of Providing Surgical Care in Eastern Zambia\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n17\nFigure 2. Elective Camp operations \nFigure 3. Emergency camp operations \naged by physiotherapists and all other fractures are referred \nto the next level of care. All district hospitals refer emer\u00ad\ngency general surgical cases to referral hospitals. Exhaus\u00ad\ntion, inadequate supply of consumables and a lack of expe\u00ad\nrienced personnel are the major findings. With the district \nhospitals not doing elective operations patients with surgi\u00ad\ncal conditions worsen or complicate. For Example, hernias \nhave ended up being referred as complicated cases to the \nnext level of care. This becomes a huge cost on both the \nhealthcare system and the patient. There are patients who \nhave also suffered socio-economic injustice due to inacces\u00ad\nsibility of surgical care. For instance, the team operated on \na man with a Hydrocele which had 2.7 liters of fluid, he was \nnot able to socialize freely and was not economically pro\u00ad\nductive for a long time. Lumps and bumps were the major\u00ad\nity of elective cases we encountered but surprisingly, there \nwere no records of these excisions being done in most hos\u00ad\npitals. There are untold costs of referrals and morbidity plus \nmortality from these complicated cases that need to be as\u00ad\nsessed. \nChallenges of Providing Surgical Care in Eastern Zambia\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n18\nTable 2. Challenges to Surgical care \nSN \nChallenges \nFrequency \n1 \nLack of surgical supplies \n28 \n2 \nLack of anesthesia drugs \n19 \n3 \nInadequate number of anesthesia \nproviders \n29 \n4 \nUnavailability of operating \ntheatre nurses \n12 \n5 \nNot enough Doctors \n27 \n6 \nLack of expertise \n21 \n7 \nExhausted operating team \n31 \n8 \nLack of ICU space \n25 \n9 \nNot interested \n1 \n10 \nNo refresher courses \n28 \nAmong the poor staffing levels for the operating the\u00ad\natres, anesthesia providers are the least in the province. \nSome hospitals have no provider such that the teams are \nforced to learn how to provide lifesaving anesthesia only \nand refer the rest.14 In hospitals where only a single person \nis tasked to give anesthesia, there are reports of exhaustion \nand referrals become the rescue. There is a need to increase \nthe recruitment of more medical doctors and anesthesia \nproviders as a matter of urgency to all DHs. This may \nborder on policymakers and politicians understanding the \nscope of this demand15 as this will increase the chances \nof achieving UHC.16 The main source of income for most \npeople in the region is farming. This makes it difficult for \nthese patients to leave the farm work and visit a health facil\u00ad\nity for most surgical diseases unless it is a debilitating con\u00ad\ndition. On the other hand, referral to the higher level of care \nis viewed costly as most of them cannot easily afford. The \npoor health seeking behavior is also in part due to poor ed\u00ad\nucation levels and has led to delayed presentations and poor \noutcomes. It is important to mention also that access to clin\u00ad\nics and hospitals is not easy. People have to move long dis\u00ad\ntances in order to find a facility. These reasons may have \nled to so many patients not showing up during the surgical \ncamps. If it was possible, the best approach would be to op\u00ad\nerate on these patients immediately when they present with\u00ad\nout asking them to come back on an elective day because \nthey are more likely not to show up. Poor infrastructure, in\u00ad\nconsistent availability of medical and surgical supplies and \nin some cases, lack of surgical skills have also glossily at\u00ad\ntributed to poor surgical care in the province. \nZambia needs to invest in UHC with a holistic approach \nas recommended in the NSOAPs guidelines to improve \nsurgical outcomes.2 We propose basic surgical operations, \nsuch as excisions of lumps and bumps, Hernia repairs, hy\u00ad\ndrocele surgeries, simple fracture management, amputa\u00ad\ntions, Incisions and drainage of abscesses, and some emer\u00ad\ngency laparotomies to be offered in the district hospitals. \nThis will demand for improved staff posting, skill enhance\u00ad\nment among the local teams, infrastructure development as \nwell as a consistent supply of consumables. Some of the \nneglected surgical cases in rural hospitals are hernias, skin \nexcisions, hydroceles, burn management, and approaches \nto different emergency surgical cases. Short courses, such \nas basic surgical skills, basic non-operative fracture man\u00ad\nagement, management of medical-surgical emergencies are \nhighly recommended for all the critical health workers in \nrural hospitals. \nSurgical camps and mentorship programs can also help \nto support the local teams with clearing booked cases and \ntransfer of skills. However, this may be more costly than the \nother methods. \nCONCLUSION \nThere is very little surgery being done in rural hospitals, \nas obstetric emergency cases have taken over the over\u00ad\nstretched systems. The burden of surgery in rural commu\u00ad\nnities is huge and the load is increasing every day. There is \na need to bridge the gap so that we can take surgery closer \nto the communities where access will be easier and reduce \nthe cost on both the patient and the health care system. \nRecruitment of more health workers, consistent supply of \nconsumables, improvement of infrastructure, and skill en\u00ad\nhancements will improve surgical outcomes. \nDisclosure \nThis project was sponsored by the Royal College of Sur\u00ad\ngeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) through the Fellowship of \nRemote Rural Humanitarian Healthcare (FRRHH).

Mini-cholecystectomy (MC) offers \na viable alternative for gallstone management in similar settings. Objectives: This study assessed the safety, efficacy, and \neducational value of MC performed by consultants and trainee registrars in a resource-limited setting, evaluating clinical \noutcomes across different operator experience levels. \nMethods \nA single-blinded, prospective, descriptive, and analytical study was conducted in surgical facilities in Kassala State, Sudan, \nfrom January 2018 to December 2021. All patients undergoing MC for gallstone disease during this period were included. Data \nwere collected on demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, hospital stay, postoperative outcomes, and pain management. \nOutcomes were compared between consultants and trainee registrars using the chi-square test, with significance set at P < \n0.05. \nResults \n600 patients underwent MC, with consultants performing 58% of procedures. The mean patient age was 43 years, and \nthe male-to-female ratio was 1:4.9. Hospital stay averaged 2.9 days, with registrars performing more surgeries in patients \nrequiring longer stays (P < 0.0001). Postoperative vomiting was more common in registrar cases (P < 0.0001), and registrar \npatients reported slightly higher pain scores (P < 0.0001). Biliary injury occurred in three cases. Mini-cholecystectomy \ndemonstrated safety and efficacy in the surgical training unit, with a low biliary injury rate (0.5%) and manageable \npostoperative pain (mean score of 5.4). It also proved a valuable training standard, as registrars performed 42% of procedures \nwith acceptable outcomes. \nConclusions \nMini-cholecystectomy is a safe, effective, and accessible alternative to LC in LMICs. It also serves as a valuable training tool for \nsurgical registrars. This study supports the expanded use of MC in resource-limited settings to improve access to gallstone \nmanagement while providing effective training for surgical residents. \nIntroduction \nAccess to quality healthcare remains a critical issue in de\u00ad\nveloping low- and middle-income countries, where re\u00ad\nsources are limited, and there is limited data on healthcare \nstandards and quality of care.

MC is a suitable alternative to LC, particularly in com\u00ad\nplex cases, such as acute cholecystitis, empyema, or gall\u00ad\nbladder mucocele. The operation is defined as a procedure \nfor removing the gallbladder using a 3-6 cm incision in the \nright upper quadrant performed in the standard open surgi\u00ad\ncal setting. This procedure is associated with fewer compli\u00ad\ncations and a shorter postoperative recovery period in com\u00ad\nparison to regular open cholecystectomy, making it suitable \nfor settings with limited resources3,4 \nThe high cost of minimally invasive surgery in LMICs \nhighlights the need for cost-effective, practical, and safe ap\u00ad\nproaches that can be adapted to resource constraints. MC \noffers a feasible alternative in such settings by providing \nsafe and effective outcomes with lower resource demands, \nas shown in some studies.4\u20117 The objectives of this study \nwere to determine if MC can serve as both an effective and \nsafe treatment for gallstone disease and a sustainable train\u00ad\ning standard adapted to the practical realities of the limited \nresources in Eastern Sudan. \nPatients and Methods \nThis single-blinded, prospective descriptive, and analytical \nstudy was conducted in surgical health facilities in Kassala \nState, Sudan, from January 2018 to December 2021. All \npatients presenting with gallstone disease who underwent \nmini-cholecystectomy during this period were included, \nwith no exclusion criteria. This approach allowed for a \ncomprehensive, convenient sample of all eligible patients \nwithin the specified timeframe. Written informed consent \nwas obtained from each patient or their legal guardian be\u00ad\nfore the procedure, and all methods adhered to relevant reg\u00ad\nulations and guidelines. The Ethics and Research Commit\u00ad\ntee of Kassala Police Hospital granted ethical approval. A \ncontrol group of two consultants was compared to an in\u00ad\ndex group of eight trainee registrars who had completed \nspecific training in mini-laparotomy cholecystectomy and \ncould perform the procedure independently. Data were col\u00ad\nlected prospectively from patient records, directly observ\u00ad\ning patient outcomes over a one-year follow-up period. \nVariables included operator role (consultant or registrar), \npatient demographics (age, gender, and comorbidities), di\u00ad\nagnosis, hospital stay duration, biliary injury incidence, \npostoperative vomiting, and pain management (analgesia \nand opioid use). Pain management protocols were standard\u00ad\nized across both groups to ensure uniformity in postoper\u00ad\native care, and a Visual Analog Pain Scale was used to \nassess pain severity. Discharge Criteria were stable vital \nsigns, pain control, oral intake, absence of complications, \nmobilization, normal urinary function, and understanding \nof postoperative care. To calculate the sample size, the sig\u00ad\nnificance level was set at 0.05 (5%), and power was set at \n80% to detect a true difference. An appropriate formula was \nused using prior data. After calculations and adjustments, \nthe total was set at 600 patients, allowing sufficient statisti\u00ad\ncal power to detect differences in the key outcomes across \nthe two groups. All patients admitted within the study pe\u00ad\nriod were included to avoid selection bias. The relevant \nguidelines and regulations followed the rules and princi\u00ad\nples of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 for medical re\u00ad\nsearch. All patients consented to participate in the study and \npublication of the results. All patient\u2019s data were analyzed \nanonymously to ensure confidentiality. \nOperative Procedure \nThe procedure commenced with confirmation of diagnosis \nand acquisition of informed consent. Patients were posi\u00ad\ntioned supine on a bridging table, and general anesthesia \nwas administered. The skin was prepped and draped for the \naseptic technique. A right subcostal transverse incision was \nmade through the abdominal wall down to the peritoneum. \nDeaver\u2019s retractor and bowel gauze were used for retrac\u00ad\ntion, with traction applied to the gallbladder fundus. Dissec\u00ad\ntion of Calot\u2019s triangle was performed, followed by ligation \nand division of both the cystic artery and cystic duct. The \ngallbladder bed was then dissected from the liver, and clo\u00ad\nsure was achieved in layers. \nData Analysis \nData were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0, with statisti\u00ad\ncal significance set at P < 0.05 and a 95% confidence inter\u00ad\nval. Frequency distributions of variables were obtained, and \ncross-tabulations were conducted to compare results be\u00ad\ntween consultants and trainee registrars, with the chi-square \ntest used to assess significance. \nResults \nA total of 600 patients underwent MC over the four-year \nstudy period. The study included two consultant surgeons \nand eight trainee registrars, with a ratio of 1:4. Consultants \noperated on 58% of the cases, which included initial \ndemonstrations for registrars and handling more complex \ncases. The mean age of patients was 43 years (\u00b112.5 SD), \nranging from 17 to 90. Notably, 14% (85 patients) were \nover 60, and registrars operated on 46.9% of these older pa\u00ad\ntients. The age distribution was significantly skewed to the \nright. The male-to-female ratio among patients was 1:4.9. \nA statistically significant correlation was found between \ngender and operator (P = 0.049), as shown in Table 1. \nThe distribution of operations by consultants and registrars \nMini-cholecystectomy, A Standard of Care and Training in Limited Resource Health Facilities: An Example \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n22\nTable 1.

Among patients, 10.3% (62) had \ncomorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, bronchial \nasthma, or a history of acute coronary syndrome. Registrars \noperated on 42% of patients without comorbidities and 45% \nwith comorbidities. However, this difference was not statis\u00ad\ntically significant. \nRegarding diagnosis, 49%(296) had symptomatic gall\u00ad\nstones, 42% (250) had chronic calculus cholecystitis, 8% \n(48) had acute calculus cholecystitis, and 1% (6) had \nempyema gallbladder. Registrars operated on these cases at \nsimilar rates to consultants, with a slightly higher rate of \nempyema (50%) and a lower rate of acute calculus chole\u00ad\ncystitis (37%), though these differences were statistically \ninsignificant. The average hospital stay was 2.9 days (\u00b10.9 \nSD), ranging from 2 to 15 days, including the preoperative \npreparation day. Table 2 shows the relationship between \nhospital stay duration and the operator. The percentage of \noperations by registrars was highest in patients with a 4-day \nstay (61.2%), while the average across all lengths of stay \nwas close to 42%. This correlation was statistically signif\u00ad\nicant (P < 0.0001). Biliary injury occurred in 3 patients \n(0.5% of total cases), all operated on by registrars. This \ncomplication rate was 1.2% among patients treated by reg\u00ad\nistrars and did not occur in patients treated by consultants (P \n= 0.042), as shown in Table 3. Pain levels were assessed on \na 0-10 visual pain scale, with a mean score of 5.4 (\u00b11.2 SD). \nA small subset (3.7%) required no analgesia, while 2.2% re\u00ad\nquired injectable analgesia more than three times, and only \n0.7% required opioids. Registrars primarily operated on pa\u00ad\ntients with pain scores of 6 or higher, and this correlation \nwas significant (P < 0.0001), as shown in Figure 1. The \nnumber of retractors used was also analyzed for their effect \non pain, showing no significant impact on pain scores de\u00ad\nspite variation from 1 to 3 retractors (P < 0.0001). Postop\u00ad\nerative vomiting occurred in 38% of patients, with a 2.1:1 \nratio favoring a higher incidence in patients operated on by \nregistrars compared to consultants (68% vs. 32%). This cor\u00ad\nrelation was statistically significant (P < 0.0001), as shown \nin Figure 2. Vomiting generally lasted 1-2 days postopera\u00ad\ntively. \nDiscussion \nThis study underscores MC as a feasible and effective sur\u00ad\ngical option for gallstone disease in resource-limited set\u00ad\ntings. Given the challenges of adopting LC in LMICs due to \nthe cost and availability of specialized equipment, MC of\u00ad\nfers a cost-effective, accessible alternative that still enables \ngood clinical outcomes. Our findings align with research \nshowing MC\u2019s role as a suitable alternative where resource \nconstraints limit access to LC, particularly in settings simi\u00ad\nlar to ours in Eastern Sudan.4 One of the key insights from \nour study is the operative role distribution between con\u00ad\nsultants and registrars. Consultants performed 58% of the \nprocedures, indicating their involvement in demonstrating \ntechniques and managing more complex cases. This struc\u00ad\ntured engagement of consultants supports registrars\u2019 train\u00ad\ning and allows MC to serve as an effective educational \ntool in surgical training. The association between the op\u00ad\nerators and various clinical outcomes is noteworthy, par\u00ad\nticularly with statistically significant differences in patient \ngender and hospital stay duration. In our study, registrars \nperformed surgeries in 46.9% of patients over 60, suggest\u00ad\ning that MC can be adapted as a training procedure in this \ndemographic with favorable outcomes. Additionally, this \nstudy affirms the feasibility and safety of the mini-chole\u00ad\nMini-cholecystectomy, A Standard of Care and Training in Limited Resource Health Facilities: An Example \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n23\nTable 2.

Patients operated on by \nregistrars reported higher pain levels, with a mean visual \npain score of 5.4 (\u00b11.2 SD) and a significant correlation be\u00ad\ntween pain intensity and the registrar group (P < 0.0001). \nThis discrepancy may be attributed to variations in techni\u00ad\ncal proficiency, as surgical skill often improves with expe\u00ad\nrience. However, overall pain outcomes remain consistent \nwith studies indicating that MC provides low postoperative \npain intensity comparable to LC.13,14 The minimal need for \nanalgesics, with only 2.2% requiring injectable analgesia \nmore than three times, highlights the feasibility of MC as a \nminimally invasive technique regarding pain management. \nHospital stay duration was also significantly associated \nwith the operator, with the mean stay at 2.9 days (\u00b10.9 SD). \nThe duration of hospital stays ranged from 2 to 15 days, and \nregistrars tended to operate on patients requiring extended \nhospital stays, particularly those staying 4 days (61.2% of \nthese cases). This correlation was statistically significant \n(P < 0.0001), suggesting a learning curve in postoperative \nmanagement. Nevertheless, MC has shown comparable re\u00ad\ncovery times to LC in other studies, supporting its efficacy \nin reducing hospital stays in LMICs.15\u201118 \nBiliary injury is the most feared complication in chole\u00ad\ncystectomy procedures; it is a key measure of surgical \nsafety, occurring in only 0.5% of cases (3 patients), exclu\u00ad\nsively in surgeries performed by registrars. This rate of bil\u00ad\niary injury (1.2% for registrars) underscores the potential \nlearning curve in MC but remains low, aligning with find\u00ad\nings that MC and LC both have rare occurrences of biliary \ninjury with adequate supervised training.4 Importantly, no \nbiliary injuries were reported in consultant-led surgeries (P \n= 0.042), reinforcing the importance of structured surgical \ntraining and experienced oversight in minimizing compli\u00ad\ncations. \nThe study also explored postoperative vomiting, a sig\u00ad\nnificant finding with a higher incidence in patients operated \non by registrars (68% vs. 32% for consultants; P < 0.0001). \nThis could be attributed to subtle technical differences, \nthough it did not affect overall outcomes. With its straight\u00ad\nforward approach, MC enables registrars to develop fun\u00ad\ndamental surgical skills, which previous studies affirm by \nshowing low complication rates comparable to those in \nLC.18 Nevertheless, this aspect highlights the need to con\u00ad\ntinuously evaluate surgical techniques to minimize adverse \neffects, particularly in training environments. In a training \nunit, the trainees are expected to tend to operate in less com\u00ad\nplex cases. , The study determined the complexity of cases \nbased on preoperative clinical assessment and ultrasound \nfindings. Clinically, complex cases included patients with \nrecurrent biliary colic, prolonged symptoms, a history of \nacute cholecystitis, or a previous abdominal procedure. Ul\u00ad\ntrasound criteria included a thickened gallbladder wall (>4 \nmm), pericholecystic fluid, contracted gallbladder, or im\u00ad\npacted stones in the neck or cystic duct. Urgency is often \ncomplex, as it is acute calculus cholecystitis or empyema. \nThis study\u2019s findings affirm that MC offers a compa\u00ad\nrable and often lower-cost alternative to LC, as previous \nstudies have shown that MC reduces the need for special\u00ad\nized equipment and can reduce hospitalization costs due \nto shorter operative times and fewer postoperative require\u00ad\nments. This cost-effectiveness is particularly beneficial in \nLMICs, where healthcare budgets are constrained, and \nequipment limitations prevail.19\u201121 The overall cost savings \nassociated with MC support its growing role as a practical \nalternative to LC, especially for routine cholecystectomies, \nas no complex, expensive surgical set-up is essential.22 \nRecent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of mini-\nlaparotomy and mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy as al\u00ad\nternatives to traditional open and multi-port laparoscopic \ncholecystectomy, particularly in challenging cases or re\u00ad\nsource-limited settings. In Sudan, a 512-case study demon\u00ad\nstrated the feasibility of mini-laparotomy cholecystectomy, \nachieving low complication rates and short hospital stays, \nproving it to be a safe and cost-effective option in resource-\nconstrained environments.23 Another study compared la\u00ad\nparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy (LSTC) with open to\u00ad\ntal cholecystectomy (OTC) in patients with difficult \ngallbladders, showing that LSTC had advantages such as \nreduced blood loss, shorter operative times, and a lower risk \nof bile duct injuries, making it a safer choice for complex \ngallbladder cases.24 Mini-cholecystectomy has been shown \nto decrease postoperative pain, enhance cosmetic outcomes, \nand accelerate recovery, although it requires more experi\u00ad\nence to overcome visibility challenges in complex cases.25 \nIn evaluating MC, it\u2019s critical to consider patient-specific \nfactors that impact the incidence of complications. Vari\u00ad\nables like acute cholecystitis, anatomical anomalies, and \nprevious abdominal surgeries can significantly impact sur\u00ad\ngical outcomes, irrespective of the operating surgeon\u2019s ex\u00ad\nperience. A comprehensive evaluation that accounts for \nthese factors is crucial to accurately attribute the causes \nof such complications. This applies to the biliary injuries \nthat occurred exclusively in the registrar-performed group, \nwhich may suggest a difference in outcomes between con\u00ad\nsultants and registrars. Although there were only three in\u00ad\njuries in a sample of 600 patients, the sample size may be \ninsufficient to detect a significant difference between the \ntwo groups. This may require a larger sample size to ensure \nthat the observed difference is not due to random variation \nbut represents a true disparity in surgical outcomes.26,27 \nMini-cholecystectomy, A Standard of Care and Training in Limited Resource Health Facilities: An Example \u2026\nEast and Central African Journal of Surgery\n25\nStudies comparing MC and LC have given mixed re\u00ad\nsults. Some research indicates that LC offers benefits of \nreduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and \nquicker return to regular activities. However, other studies \nsuggest that MC may have advantages such as shorter oper\u00ad\native times and lower costs.[28.29] \nThe results of mini-laparotomy approaches offer sig\u00ad\nnificant benefits for patients with complicated gallstone \ndisease, offering suitable, safe alternatives to conventional \nopen cholecystectomy. Our study showed the same good \noutcomes with the additional value of presenting a surgical \ntraining model. \nConclusions \nMini-cholecystectomy (MC) is a safe, effective, and feasi\u00ad\nble surgical option for gallstone disease in a resource-lim\u00ad\nited setting in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). \nThe procedure is simple and achieves favorable patient out\u00ad\ncomes, including acceptable levels of postoperative pain, \nshort hospital stays, and low complication rates. It also \nserves as an effective training tool in surgical education \nprograms, where access to advanced laparoscopic equip\u00ad\nment may be limited. \nStudy Strengths \nIn this study, patient selection bias was avoided by includ\u00ad\ning all eligible patients. Direct observation and supervision \nof the outcomes enhance data reliability. As a training stan\u00ad\ndard, the comparison between consultants and trainees will \nprovide more insights into its suitability. Moreover, ethical \napproval and consent for participation and publication en\u00ad\nhance the article\u2019s credibility. \nWeaknesses and Limitations \nThe weak points are that it\u2019s a single-center study, on the \nregistrar group, there are many operators, and the follow-\nup was limited to one year, which may overlook long-term \ncomplications. Additionally, the low incidence of bile duct \ninjury may indicate the need for a bigger sample size to ac\u00ad\ncurately evaluate this complication. There was no real ran\u00ad\ndomization of the cases between consultant and registrar \ngroups, which may include selection bias of cases. \nRecommendations \n1.

However, biochemical and clinical equivalence \nbetween BTO and BSCO among native Africans is undocumented.\nObjective: To compare the biochemical response (testosterone and prostate specific antigen) in patients who had BTO and \nBSCO for advanced prostate cancer.\nMethods: A randomized single- blind study of 64 consenting patients that underwent either BTO or BSCO. Pre- and post-op-\nerative PSA and testosterone assays were done serially at intervals and compared between each treatment group.\nResults: Each treatment group were similar with no statistically significant difference in terms of age (p= 0.449) or degree of \ntumor differentiation (p =0.714). Neither median testosterone (p= 0.515) nor the mean pre-operative PSA differ between the \ntwo groups (p = 0.482). Also, similar trends were noticed post operatively except at the 2nd month when a statistically significant \ndifference was recorded (p = 0.003).\nConclusion: The two techniques of orchidectomy were effective in accomplishing androgen deprivation. They produced similar \nbiochemical (testosterone and PSA) response.\nKeywords: androgen deprivation therapy; subcapsular orchidectomy; total orchidectomy.\nDOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v23i1.50\nCite as: Arogundade AK, Popoola AA, Ajape AA, Abiola OO, Biliaminu SA.

In a more recent communi-\nty-based screening in Nigeria, high prevalence was ob-\nserved with majority already had advanced disease at the \ntime of diagnosis2.\nIn many of the studies in Nigeria, late presentation with \nan advanced stage of the disease was the norm3\u20137. Due to \nthe late presentation, treatment has been essentially pal-\nliative with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) aimed \nat achieving castrate testosterone levels; i.e., (testosterone \nlevel of less than 50ng/dl or less than 5% of serum tes-\ntosterone before castration)8,9. Androgen deprivation can \nbe achieved either surgically (by a bilateral orchidectomy) \nor by medical therapy with (Luteinizing Hormone Releas-\ning Hormone (LHRH) analogs/antagonists, anti-andro-\ngens, or oestrogens). Bilateral total orchidectomy (BTO), \nwhich involves total excision of the testes and epididy-\nmis, has been found to achieve castrate testosterone levels \nwithin 24 hours10. It is a one-time treatment and the least \nexpensive with comparable efficacy to other modalities \nof treatment10,11. Despite this, most patients especially in \ndeveloped countries, when given a choice prefer medical \nandrogen ablation due to psychological effect of an emp-\nty scrotum and poor body image12,13.\nRiba in 1942 described the technique of bilateral sub-\ncapsular orchidectomy (BSCO), which entails leaving the \ntunica albuginea and epididymis in the scrotum 14.

However, Mc-\nDonald and Calams in 1959 showed that the tunica al-\nbuginea and epididymis when retained in a sub-capsular \norchidectomy have Leydig-like cells which continue to \nproduce testosterone thereby precluding complete an-\ndrogen ablation at the testicular level 15. Also, O\u2019Conor et \nal, in 1963 showed that human chorionic gonadotrophin \nstimulation in patients, who have undergone sub-capsu-\nlar orchidectomy, produced an increase in urinary excre-\ntion of testosterone metabolic product (androsterone) \n16. These studies questioned the efficacy of BSCO; thus, \nBTO was promoted as the treatment of choice 17.\nRecently, there has been a renewed interest in BSCO as \na treatment option in advanced prostate cancer because \nof the observed persistent oncological effectiveness, and \nbetter psychological outcomes 18. Furthermore, some \nstudies have also found significantly fewer post-operative \ncomplications with BSCO than BTO 13,19.\nDemonstration of the biochemical response to either \ntype of bilateral orchidectomy in native Africans are rath-\ner scanty in indexed publications. Furthermore, prostate \ncancer has a heterogeneous tumor presentation coupled \nwith the significant racial differences in the incidence, \nprevalence, biologic behavior, stage at presentation and \nmortality 2,20. These warrants evaluating therapeutic op-\ntions available to patients in real world settings 4,21,23. \nThus, we sought to compare the efficacy of the two types \nof orchidectomy in terms of biochemical response in pa-\ntients of African descent in our country.\nMethods\nA prospective, single blind randomized and comparative \nhospital-based study among all consecutive advanced \nprostate cancer patients presenting to the Urology Divi-\nsion of a tertiary hospital, North Central, Nigeria over a \nperiod of 12months.\nSample Size Estimation\nSample size was determined with the formula: n= [A+B] \n2 \u00d72 \u00d7 SD2 / DIFF2 where n= the sample size required \nin each group (double this for total sample); SD= stan-\ndard deviation of primary outcome variable from previ-\nous study; DIFF= size of difference of clinical impor-\ntance; A= significance level; B= documented mean power \nof 80% from previous study Values were deduced from \na previous local study by Magoha (24), who assessed sub-\ncapsular orchidectomy in management of prostate cancer \nin Nigerians.\nHence, n= [1.96+0.84]2 \u00d72\u00d7212/14.62 = 32.4 approx-\nimately 32 patients and the total sample size was 2n=64 \npatients.\nInclusion Criterion\nConsenting patients with diagnosis of advanced pros-\ntate cancer that chose bilateral orchidectomy as mode of \ntreatment.\nExclusion Criteria\nPatients excluded were those other histo-pathological \ntypes of prostate cancer, patients on neo-adjuvant hor-\nmonal therapy during the study period, patients with de-\nbilitating co- morbidities and patients with synchronous \ntumors.\nEthical consideration\nEthical clearance was obtained from the hospital Ethical \nReview Committee (ERC) for a period of one-year. In-\nformed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled \nin the study. Patient refusal to participate or desire to \nwithdraw participation at any stage of the study was re-\nspected without attempt at coercion or inducement. Strict \nconfidentiality was adhered to in the management of pa-\ntient records, results and details.\nPatient selection and randomization\nThe patients recruited for the study were randomized to \neither of the two procedures designated as A and B in \nequal numbers using block randomization to limit bias \nand achieve even distribution between the treatment \narms. Group A patients had bilateral sub-capsular or-\nchidectomy (BSCO) while Group B patients had bilateral \ntotal orchidectomy (BTO).\nA block size of four (4) was used because of the esti-\nmated sample size and the need to achieve an even bal-\nance between the groups. Each block contained an even \nnumber of four (4) procedures equally distributed but in \ndifferent order; i.e., by random permutation.\nThe recruitment of patients for the study ended after at-\ntaining the estimated sample size.\nAfrican Health Sciences, Vol 23 Issue 1, March, 2023\n484\nPeri-operative Assessment\nAll recruited patients had thorough clinical evaluation \nfrom the onset with detailed history and physical exam-\nination followed by appropriate pre-operative investiga-\ntions such as complete blood count, fasting serum glu-\ncose and renal function test.\nSurgical Procedure\nProcedures were carried out in supine position after ad-\nministering pre-incision testicular nerve block (spermatic \ncord) with 1% lidocaine. This entails palpating and pick-\ning the spermatic cord between the thumb and index fin-\nger about 1cm infero-medial to the ipsilateral pubic tu-\nbercle. A fine needle (size 23G) was used to inject the 1% \nlidocaine to the overlying skin (wheal) and then further \ndown into the cord. Care was taken to aspirate each time \nbefore injecting anaesthetic agent to avoid intravascular \ndelivery. The proposed line of skin incision was also in-\nfiltrated with 1% lidocaine. These procedures were per-\nformed by the lead surgeon and trained senior registrars \nin Urology Division.\nSubcapsular Orchidectomy 25: A longitudinal median \nraphe scrotal incision was made after grasping the scro-\ntum behind the testes to tense the overlying skin. The in-\ncision was deepened through the dartos muscle and cre-\nmasteric layers in each hemi-scrotum down to the tunica \nvaginalis. Each testis was delivered into the wound after \nopening the tunica vaginalis. The tunica albuginea was in-\ncised along the entire length of the anterior border and a \npiece of gauze used in sweeping out the testicular tissue \nfrom the edges to the center. A 3/0 vicryl suture was used \nto ligate the scooped tissue at the hilus before excision. \nThe inner surface of the tunica albuginea as well as the \nbase was fulgurated to destroy residual interstitial cells, \nand to control bleeding. Repair of the tunica albuginea \nwas done with continuous 2/0 vicryl suture. Cauterization \nof bleeders in the dartos was done before closure with \ncontinuous 3/0 vicryl suture. Skin closure was achieved \nwith 3/0 nylon vertical mattress sutures. Scrotal dressing \nwas firmly applied and left in situ for 48hrs before release \nand wound inspection.\nTotal Orchidectomy 25: Median raphe scrotal skin inci-\nsion was made to deliver the testis into the wound from \neach hemi-scrotum and to expose the epididymis and the \ncord. The vas deferens was bluntly dissected from the \nspermatic vessels to ligate separately due to its blood sup-\nply. It was double clamped proximally and single clamped \ndistally before dividing. It is doubly ligated with 3/0 vic-\nryl suture. The rest of the cord was separated into two \nor three parts, doubly clamped, divided between clamps \nand ligated distally and proximally with 3/0vicryl. Cau-\nterization of bleeders in the dartos was done before clo-\nsure with continuous 3/0 vicryl suture. Skin closure was \nachieved with 3/0 nylon vertical mattress sutures and \nscrotal dressing firmly applied for 48hrs before release of \npressure scrotal dressing.\nData collection and analysis\nA structured proforma was use to collect socio-demo-\ngraphic data, Gleason\u2019s score, testosterone and prostate \nspecific antigen (PSA) for each patient. Blood samples for \ntestosterone and PSA for biochemical assays were first \ndrawn on the morning of surgery and ended at the third \nmonth of follow-up.\nThe data obtained were analysed using Statistical Pack-\nage for Social Science \u201cIBM SPSS version 20.0\u201d Armonk, \nNY: IBM Corp. Mean and range were determined for \nvariables with normal distribution while median and in-\nterquartile ranges were determined for non- parametric \nvariables. The pre-operative and post \u2013operative tes-\ntosterone and PSA values were compared between and \nwithin the groups using Mann-Whitney-U test and paired \nsample t-test respectively based on the socio-demograph-\nics and Gleason\u2019s score using Chi square. The results were \ndisplayed using tables and graph. For all statistical tests, p \n< 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nSixty-four patients were recruited for the study (32 pa-\ntients in each group). Mean age was 70.84\u00b18.18years \nwith a range of 49 to 90 years and the. majority of the \nsubjects (93.8%) were married (Table 1). Comparison of \nthe socio-demographic characteristics of the two study \ngroups is as shown in Table 2.0. Mean age in BTO and \nBSCO groups were 71.63 \u00b1 7.56 years and 70.06 \u00b1 8.79 \nyears respectively (p = 0.449). The mean Gleason\u2019s score \nof all subjects was 7.38 (\u00b11.35) with a range of 4 to 9. \nThe Gleason score of the tumor differentiation revealed \nthat 50.0% were poorly differentiated (\u22658), 29.7% were \nmoderately differentiated (7) and 20.3% were well differ-\nentiated (\u22646). The mean Gleason\u2019s score was 7.44\u00b11.41 \nvs. 7.31\u00b11.31 in the BTO and BSCO group respectively \n(p =0.714).\nAfrican Health Sciences, Vol 23 Issue 1, March, 2023\n485\nThe median testosterone level of all subjects pre-oper-\natively was 475ng/dl. The lowest testosterone value of \n27ng/dl was recorded at 48hours post operatively, though \ncastrate level (<50ng/dl) was already attained at 6hours \npost operatively.

This represents a better match \ncompared to a previous study by Zhang et al 13, in which \nthe BSCO group had more poorly differentiated tumors. \nProstate specific antigen (PSA) values which are useful in \nassessing prostate cancer were assessed pre- and post-or-\nchidectomy serially. The mean pre- operative serum PSA \nvalue of 59.82\u00b129.22 ng/ml using ELISA technique ob-\nserved among the subjects. This value was beyond the \nexpected value of <4ng/ml in healthy adult. However, \nthis does not foreclose the fact that low serum PSA have \nbeen associated with non-palpable but clinically signifi-\ncant prostate cancer and high Gleason score 27,28.\nComparison of the pre-operative serum PSA values be-\ntween the BTO and BSCO group yielded mean values of \n62.41ng/ml and 57.23ng/ml respectively. The difference \nobserved was not statistically significant and was in keep-\ning with the extent of tumour differentiation as demon-\nstrated by the mean Gleason\u2019s score of 7.44 and 7.31 for \nBTO and BSCO respectively. This high value of serum \nPSA in recruited patients was also noticed by Magoha in \nNairobi 29 where 92% of patients with advanced prostate \ncancer had PSA >20ng/ml.\nFollowing orchidectomy (all 64 subjects), a significant \ndrop in serum PSA was observed till the 2nd month when \nmean value of 20.59\u00b118.96ng/ml was recorded. This was \nfollowed by a slight rise in mean value to 23.06\u00b122.48ng/\nml in the third month. This sharp drop in serum PSA \nwas more pronounced with the BSCO group in the 2nd \nmonth (p=0.003). However, the trend was not sustained \ninto the 3rd month. On the contrary, a gradual but con-\nsistent decline of serum PSA was observed for BTO \ngroup throughout the course of measurement. It can be \ninferred that the slight rise in serum PSA (all 64 subjects) \nnoticed in the 3rd month was contributed by those pa-\ntients that had BSCO.\nThe role of serum PSA as a biomarker for prostate can-\ncer diagnosis, prognosis, treatment monitoring as well as \nsurvival evaluation is well established 30\u201332; thus, the de-\ncline in PSA noted in this study was expected after or-\nchidectomy due to loss of androgen trophism 33. How-\never, the extent of decline and interval it takes to get to \nthe nadir level was variable 32, depending on the death of \ndifferentiated neoplastic cells and/or decrease in expres-\nsion of androgen receptor (AR) stimulated PSA in sur-\nviving tumour cells 30,34. It may be pre-mature to conclude \nthat the PSA nadir in index study was attained at the 2nd \nmonth after surgery or that the slight rise noticed in the \n3rd month was evidence of biochemical progression due \nto relatively short period of follow-up when compared \nto similar study with mean/median follow-up period of \n28months and 35months 13,18. Albeit, it is common to \nfind patients with advanced prostate cancer who under-\ngo ADT having serum PSA nadir level of \u2264 4ng/ml at \n6/7months post- surgery 30,32,33. This difference in pattern \nin relation to the BSCO group may be attributed to the \nheterogenous nature of prostate cancer clones of cells. \nThese cells demonstrate variable degree of response to \nloss of androgen stimulus 20. However, this comparative \ndifference was not reported in previous studies 13,18 and \nmay require a larger randomized clinical trial to validate. \nThe second biochemical parameter studied was serum \ntestosterone whose median pre- operative value deter-\nmined using ELISA was 475ng/dl (all 64 subjects). This \npre-castrate value falls within the range expected for nor-\nmal males 35. This was comparable to values obtained in \nprevious studies 35\u201338 and did not differ between the two \ngroups(p=0.515). The post-operative serum testosterone \nmedian values measured serially from 0 hour (immediately \nafter removal of the testes) showed an initial steep decline \nfrom 475mg/dl to125mg/dl. This rapid drop excludes \nthe possibility of surgical maneuver causing a temporary \nspike in the serum level testosterone. Similar precipitous \ndecline was noted by Arcadi39 in fivof the six patients that \nhad sub- capsular orchidectomy with serial monitoring \nof serum testosterone values. The post-operative chang-\nes based on surgical technique employed revealed that at \n0 hour (i.e, immediately after orchidectomy), there was \nan approximately 74% decline in the pre-operative serum \ntestosterone to produce median values of 189.5ng/dl and \n11.5ng/dl for BTO and BSCO respectively. Similar trend \nwas observed in successive measurements done at vari-\nable interval over the initial 48hours post-orchidectomy \nand at the 3rd month of follow-up. There was no signifi-\ncant difference but a near perfect alignment from the 3rd \nhour after surgery to the 3rd month of follow-up was \nobserved.\nAttaining castrate testosterone level is the aim of ADT \nand this level is defined as <50ng/dl or <5% of pre-cas-\ntrate level though a stricter definition puts it at <20ng/\nAfrican Health Sciences, Vol 23 Issue 1, March, 2023\n489\nml 8,38. Analysis based on the technique of surgery \nshowed that patients randomized into BTO and BSCO \nall attained the castrate serum testosterone level at 6hours \npost orchidectomy with median values of 41.0ngdl and \n41.5ng/dl respectively(p=0.973). It can be inferred that \nboth surgical procedures attained similar levels of hor-\nmonal ablation.\nThe lowest median testosterone value was at 48hours \npost-surgery(27.0ng/dl) but subsequently rose to 36.0ng/\ndl at the 3rd month of follow-up. This rise may be due \nto extra-testicular sources of androgens, especially, since \nthe patients were not on maximal androgen blockade. \nThe rise in median serum testosterone level may also be \ncontributory to the increase in serum PSA value at the \n3rd month after surgery. Specifically, at the 3rd month \nof follow-up, the median serum testosterone level was \n31.5ng/dl and 42.0ng/dl for BTO and BSCO respective-\nly. In absolute terms, these values represent a rise from \nthe measurement at 48hours post-orchidectomy, with a \nhigher percentage increase recorded in the BSCO group. \nComparatively however, these changes were statistically \nnot significant and as such cannot be conclusively impli-\ncated in the rise in mean serum PSA observed in the 3rd \nmonth of follow-up among subjects that had BSCO.\nFurthermore, the linear graph comparison between the \ngroups showed a near perfect alignment from the 3rd \nhour post-surgery till the 3rd month post orchidectomy \nand there was no significant difference in the recorded \nvalues throughout the course of measurement. This find-\ning corroborates earlier studies 17,36,37 that disputed the \npossibility of persistence of \u2018residual Leydig like cells\u2019 in \npatients that had BSCO as claimed by O\u2019Conor et al 16.\nFuture research\nThe goal of treating patients with advanced prostate can-\ncer is palliative and this is to maintain as best possible \npatients\u2019 quality of life and psychological well-being. That \ncan include the cosmetic appeal of their scrotum post-sur-\ngery. Therefore, beyond the biochemical and clinical ef-\nficacy of two methods of surgical androgen deprivation, \nit is important to assess the psychological impact of each \nprocedure on the patients within a randomized trial.\nConclusion\nThis study observed that both procedures were effective \nin androgen deprivation with regards to attainment of \ncastrate testosterone level and decline in the post-opera-\ntive serum PSA. In comparing the two procedures by out-\ncomes, the study showed that the biochemical responses \nto BTO and BSCO were similar and comparable.\nReferences\n1. Ogunbiyi JO, Shittu OB.

Data on demographics, \ncancer staging, Gleason scores, treatment modalities, and outcomes were analyzed. \nResults: The mean age of patients was 70.51 years. A significant proportion (53.1%) were diagnosed with high-risk locally \nadvanced prostate cancer, and 42.9% had metastatic cancer. ADT was administered to 95.9% of patients, and 38.8% \nreceived radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) rates were 100% at 1 year, 88.9% at 3 years, and 66.7% at 5 years. The duration \nof hormonal treatment significantly impacted OS, while no significant differences were noted across age, T stage, and \nGleason score subgroups. \nConclusions: The study highlights the severity of treated prostate cancer cases and the high overall survival rates. The \nduration of hormonal treatment was a significant factor in overall survival, emphasizing the importance of treatment duration \nmanagement. \nKeywords: Prostate cancer, Androgen deprivation therapy, Radiotherapy, Survival rate, Gleason score, Hormonal \ntreatment. \n \nINTRODUCTION \nProstate cancer is the second most frequently \ndiagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-\nrelated death among men worldwide. Its treatment \noutcomes have been extensively studied, with numerous \nresearch articles examining various aspects of different \ntreatment modalities. Radical prostatectomy, a common \nsurgical treatment for localized prostate cancer, has been \nshown to significantly reduce mortality compared to \nconservative management. However, surgery is also \nassociated with potential adverse effects, including \nurinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction (1). \nRadiation therapy, including external beam radiation \ntherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy, is another primary \ntreatment option. Studies have demonstrated that EBRT \ncombined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) \nimproves overall survival in high-risk patients \n(2). \nBrachytherapy, involving the implantation of radioactive \nseeds, has been reported to have favorable long-term \nbiochemical control rates, especially in low- to \nintermediate-risk patients (3). \nHormone therapy, or ADT, is commonly used for \nadvanced or metastatic prostate cancer. While ADT can \neffectively control disease progression and alleviate \nsymptoms, it is often associated with significant side \neffects, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular issues, and \nmetabolic changes (4). Recent advancements in hormone \ntherapy, including the use of newer agents like abiraterone \nand enzalutamide, have shown promising results in \nimproving survival and quality of life in metastatic \ncastration-resistant prostate cancer (5). \nActive surveillance is an option for men with low-\nrisk prostate cancer, aiming to monitor the disease closely \nand intervene only if there is evidence of progression. \nThis approach can help avoid or delay the side effects \nassociated with more aggressive treatments. Studies have \nindicated that active surveillance is a safe and effective \nstrategy for appropriately selected patients, with \nfavorable long-term outcomes (6). \nThe choice of treatment for prostate cancer depends \non various factors, including disease stage, patient health, \nand preferences. Each treatment modality has its benefits \nand risks, and ongoing research continues to refine these \nstrategies to optimize outcomes for prostate cancer \npatients (7). This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of \ndifferent treatment strategies for prostate cancer, \nincluding surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, \nand active surveillance. By analyzing survival rates, \nrecurrence rates, and quality of life measures, this \nresearch sought to provide a comprehensive overview of \nthe efficacy and safety of these treatments. \n \nPATIENTS AND METHODS \nThis study employed a retrospective cohort design to \nanalyze the outcomes of prostate cancer treatments of \npatients diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer at the \nOncology Department of Sohag University Hospital from \nJanuary 2017 to January 2021. \n \nhttps://ejhm.journals.ekb.eg/ \n2508 \nInclusion Criteria \nPatients were eligible for inclusion if they met the \nfollowing criteria: \n\uf0b7 \nAged 18 years or older. \n\uf0b7 \nDiagnosed with any stage or grade of prostate \ncancer. \n\uf0b7 \nHistologically confirmed epithelial type of \nprostate cancer. \n \nExclusion Criteria \nPatients were excluded from the study if they met any of \nthe following criteria: \n\uf0b7 \nAged below 18 years. \n\uf0b7 \nDiagnosed with other malignancies. \nTreatment Outcome Measures \nPrimary Outcome Measures: \n\uf0b7 \nOverall Survival (OS): Defined as the time from the \ndate of diagnosis to the last date the patient was seen. \n\uf0b7 \nProgression-Free Survival (PFS): Defined as the \nlength of time during and after treatment that the \npatient lives with the disease without it worsening, \nparticularly important in the metastatic setting. \n\uf0b7 \nDisease-Free Survival (DFS): Defined as the time \nfrom the end of treatment to the date of the first \nrelapse. \n \nSecondary Outcome Measures: \n\uf0b7 \nEarly and Late Treatment Toxicities: Adverse \neffects experienced by patients during and after \ntreatment. \n \nData Collection \nPatient data were extracted from electronic health records. \nCollected data included demographics (age, race), \nprostate cancer staging (T stage), Gleason score, type of \ntreatment received (androgen deprivation therapy, \nradiotherapy, surgery), duration of treatment, and follow-\nup data. Additional data collected included  prostate-\nspecific antigen levels, presence of metastases, and \ncomorbidities. \n \nEthical Considerations \nThe privacy of patient data was strictly maintained. \nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the \nMedical Research Ethics Committee of Sohag \nUniversity Hospital. The Helsinki Declaration was \nfollowed throughout the study's conduct. \n \nStatistical Analysis \nData were analyzed using IBM SPSS software version \n25.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2017. IBM SPSS Statistics for \nWindows, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). \nQualitative data were described using frequencies and \npercentages. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to verify \nthe normality of distribution. Quantitative data were \ndescribed using the range (minimum and maximum), \nmean, standard deviation, and median. Statistical \nsignificance was judged at the 5% level. Kaplan-Meier \nsurvival curves were constructed to assess OS and PFS, \nand the Log-Rank test was used to compare survival \ndistributions between groups. \n \nRESULTS \nThe ages of the patients ranged from 49 to 88 years, \nwith a mean age of diagnosis in our cohort was 70.51 \u00b1 \n8.40 years with a range from 49 to 88 years. The majority \nof the patients (89.8%) were over 60 years old, and 67.3% \nresided in rural areas. The majority of patients (53.1%) \nwere diagnosed with high-risk locally advanced prostate \ncancer, while 42.9% had metastatic prostate cancer to the \nbone, and 4.1% had intermediate-risk prostate cancer. \nRadiological findings from MRI or CT scans before \nintervention are detailed in table 1. Significant findings \nincluded moderate to marked prostate enlargement in \n98% of patients, indentation or infiltration into nearby \nstructures in 22.4%, and the presence of metastases in \n38.8%. \n \nTable 1: Findings on MRI or CT before intervention \nin the studied prostate cancer patients. \nFindings on MRI or CT before \nintervention \nStudied patients \n(N= 49) \nN \n% \nEnlarged prostate cancer: \n- Mild \n- Moderate \n- Marked \n \n1 \n26 \n22 \n \n2.0% \n53.1% \n44.9% \nProstatic nodules or focal: \n- Single \n- Multiple \n \n0 \n1 \n \n0% \n2.0% \nRelation to nearby structure: \n- Indentation or \ninfiltration \n \n11 \n \n22.4% \nPresence of enlarged regional \nL.Ns \n6 \n12.2% \nPresence of obstructive \nuropathy (back pressure) \n2 \n4.1% \nPresence of metastasis (bone, \nlung, liver, nonregional L.Ns \nand other) \n19 \n38.8% \nMarked enlarged prostate \nwith mass invading posterior \nbladder wall \n2 \n4.1% \nCT : computed tomography .  \nMRI: Magnetic resonance imaging . \nL.N : lymph node \n \nTable 2 summarizes the tumor characteristics.

It is the most common cancer \nin men, with varying treatment outcomes depending on \nfactors such as disease stage, patient characteristics, and \ntreatment approach. Advances in medical knowledge and \ntechnology have led to improved diagnostic techniques \nand treatment options for prostate cancer. These include \nradical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate \ngland), radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, and active \nsurveillance. However, the relative effectiveness and \nlong-term outcomes of these treatments remain areas of \nactive research and clinical debate (8).  \nThe primary aim of this study was to evaluate the \nprognosis and survival rates of prostate cancer patients \ntreated at Sohag University Hospital. This retrospective \nstudy included 49 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer \nand referred to the Oncology Department between \nJanuary 2017 and January 2021. Our findings provide a \ncomprehensive overview of patient demographics, \ndisease \ncharacteristics, \ntreatment \nmodalities, \nand \noutcomes, contextualized within the broader literature. \nThe mean age at diagnosis in our cohort was 70.51 \n\u00b1 8.40 years, with a range from 49 to 88 years. The \nmajority (89.8%) were over 60 years old, and 67.3% \nresided in rural areas.  These demographics align closely \nwith those reported by Wallis et al.(9) who found a median \nage of 64 years (IQR 59-69) in their study on treatment \napproaches and outcomes in localized prostate cancer. \nSimilarly, Ozyigit et al.(10)  reported a median age range \nof 68 years (41\u201388), and Amini et al.(11)  noted that 49.3% \nof patients were over 70 years, with 45.8% between 56-\n70 years. These findings underscore the generalizability \nof our age-related findings across different geographical \nand clinical settings. \nOur study revealed that 53.1% of patients were \ndiagnosed with high-risk locally advanced prostate \ncancer, 42.9% had metastatic disease to bone, and 4.1% \nhad intermediate-risk cancer. These results are consistent \nwith those of Ozyigit et al.(10), who reported that 17.1% \nof patients had local, locoregional, or distant relapse and \n12.0% had distant metastases. Yahaya et al.(12) observed \nthat 40.5% of patients had lymph node involvement and \nmetastasis to distant organs, with 22.3% involving distant \norgans other than lymph nodes, corroborating our \nfindings on the spread of the disease at diagnosis. \nIn terms of clinical staging, T2 was the most \ncommonly observed stage (57.1%), followed by T4 \n(22.4%), T3 (16.3%), and T1 (4.1%). The mean Gleason \nscore was 7.98 \u00b1 0.90, with a primary score of 4.23 \u00b1 0.63 \nand a secondary score of 3.77 \u00b1 0.63. These values are \ncomparable to those reported by Ozyigit et al.(10)  and \ndiverge from Wallis et al.(9), who found that T1 was \nreported in 76% of their patients and T2 in 24%, with \nGleason scores of \u22646 in 52%, 3+4 in 28%, and 8-10 in \n10% of patients. This discrepancy may be attributed to \ndifferences in patient selection and diagnostic criteria \nbetween studies. \nOur treatment data indicated that 75.9% of patients \nreceived androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with a \nmean treatment duration of 23.65 \u00b1 11.7 months. This is \nin line with the findings of Wallis et al.(9), where 87% of \npatients received ADT, and Ozyigit et al.(10), who \nreported that 27.9% of patients received ADT for less than \n2 years and 72.1% for more than or equal to 2 years, with \na median duration of 24 months (range 2-72 months). The \nuse of radiotherapy was less common, with only 38.8% \nreceiving definitive radiotherapy, similar to patterns \nobserved in the literature (10,11). \nRegarding \noutcomes, \n28.6% \nof \npatients \nexperienced a rise in PSA levels, and 6.1% died from \ncancer. The overall survival (OS) rate was 93.9% at the \nstudy's end, with a mean OS of 57.7 months. Our results \nare consistent with Ozyigit et al.(10), who reported that \n82.4% of patients were alive at the end of their study, and \nYahaya et al.(12), who found a 3-year OS rate of 67.6%. \nNotably, our study did not find significant differences in \nOS related to age or treatment modalities, aligning with \nOzyigit et al.(10)  but contrasting with Kim et al.(13) who \nreported age as a significant predictor of OS. \n \nCONCLUSION \nA significant number of patients were diagnosed with \nhigh-risk and metastatic prostate cancer, reflecting the \nseverity of the cases. The treatments varied, with most \npatients receiving androgen deprivation therapy and a \nconsiderable number undergoing radiotherapy. The \noverall survival rate was relatively high, with no \nsignificant differences observed across various subgroups \nsuch as age, T stage, Gleason score, and receipt of radical \nradiotherapy. However, the duration of hormonal \ntreatment significantly influenced overall survival. \n \nConflict of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of \ninterests.  \nFunding: None \n \nREFERENCES \n1.

Biopsy techniques varied, with\nultrasound-guided biopsies being the most common (30 centres), followed by\ndigital-guided (20 centres) and MRI-guided biopsies (5 centres). One centre\nlacked the expertise to perform biopsies. Radiological workup availability was\nhigh, with CT available in 56 centres, MRI in 54, PET scans in 14, and scintigraphy\nin 29. Treatment capabilities varied, with 53.4% of centres able to perform radical\nprostatectomies, 86.2% offering radiotherapy, and 94.8% providing medical\ncastration. Among the centres, 56 performed fewer than 5 radical\nprostatectomies per month, while only 2 centres performed between 5 and 10\nper month.\nConclusion: It is important to standardise prostate cancer diagnosis and\ntreatment protocols across Africa while improving access to advanced\ndiagnostic technologies and treatment facilities. Implementing these changes\ncould enhance early detection, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce the\nburden of prostate cancer in Africa.\nKEYWORDS\nprostate, prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen, urologist, prostate cancer, Africa\n1 Introduction\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer and the \ufb01fth\nleading cause of cancer death in men in 2020, according to global\ncancer statistics. Its incidence varies from country to country (1).\nThis variation can even exist within a single country. In the United\nStates, it has been shown that the incidence of prostate cancer is\nhigher in African-Americans than in Americans of other origins (2).\nProstate cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death among men\nin 48 countries, including many in sub-Saharan Africa (1). In many\ncountries or geographical areas, population-based epidemiological\ndata are available (3\u20135). In Africa, only a few countries have\npopulation-based cancer registries, and these are not well\nequipped or regularly updated (6, 7).\nThe diagnosis of prostate cancer is traditionally based on a\ncombination of clinical, biological and histological data. Clinically,\ndiagnosis is made by digital rectal examination, which assesses the\nshape, regularity and consistency of the prostate (8). Any\nabnormality of the prostate on digital rectal examination is an\nindication for prostate biopsy (9). Biologically, prostate cancer is\nsuspected on the basis of elevated plasma levels of prostate-speci\ufb01c\nantigen. Prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen is a glycoprotein normally\nexpressed by prostate tissue and can also be elevated in men even\nwhen there is no prostate cancer involvement (10). In the PSA-\nbased screening program, most patients diagnosed with prostate\ncancer have a normal digital rectal examination (8). Thus, for\ndiagnostic con\ufb01rmation of prostate cancer, a prostate biopsy is\nmandatory. The standard technique is ultrasound-guided needle\nbiopsy of the prostate, taking 12 cores per extended sextant (8).In\nselected patients, magnetic resonance imaging may be required for\ntargeted biopsy (11). MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy, especially in\nthose patients with previous negative prostate biopsy but with\npersistent clinical signs and symptoms of prostate cancer. Biopsy\nprotocols covering indications, preparation, procedure and\nmanagement of complications are well de\ufb01ned by various\nnational and international urology societies (12, 13). However,\nthere are still wide differences in prostate biopsy practice patterns,\naccording to a survey of 51 Nigerian urologists, which revealed\nvariation in practice. The authors of this publication concluded that\npractice standardisation is required to increase consistency in\npatient treatment (14).\nOn the basis of a range of clinical, biological and histological data,\na classi\ufb01cation system has been proposed, stratifying patients into\ngroups and guiding the performance of an extensive workup\n(thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT and bone scan) (15). Depending on\nD\u2019Amico\u2019s classi\ufb01cation and the presence or absence of metastases on\nimaging, several learned societies have de\ufb01ned recommendations for\npractice (12, 13).\nThere has been a reported rise in the cancer burden in sub-\nSaharan Africa (16). In terms of incidence and mortality, prostate\nAbbreviations: ACC, Africa Cancer Coalition; ADT, Androgen deprivation\ntherapy; AUA, American Urological Association ; CPGs, Clinical practice\nguidelines; CT, Computed tomography; CT Scan, computed tomography scan;\nDRE, Digital Rectal Examination; EAU, European Urological Association;\nLLMICs, Low- and Lower-Middle-Income Countries; LMICs, low- and middle-\nincome countries; MDT, Multidisciplinary team; mpMRI, Multiparametric\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging; MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging; MUFA,\nModern Urology for Africa; NCCN, National Comprehensive Cancer Network;\nNHIS, The National Health Insurance Scheme; PCa, Prostate Cancer; PET Scan,\npositron emission tomography scan; PSA, Prostate-Speci\ufb01c Antigen; SSA, Sub\nSaharan Africa; TRUS, Transrectal Ultrasound.\nBiyouma et al.\n10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951\nFrontiers in Urology\nfrontiersin.org\n02\ncancer is the most common cancer among men in sub-Saharan\nAfrica (17). In addition to this huge burden, diagnosing and treating\nprostate cancer is challenging in sub-Saharan Africa. This is due to\nlack of access to diagnostic tools and limited healthcare resources.\nPSA testing, magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy are often\nlimited. Treatment options are often limited by a lack of quali\ufb01ed\nhuman and material resources (18). Given the above, we have asked\n3 questions within the context of sub-Saharan:\n1. What is the current practice of urologists regarding prostate\nbiopsy across Africa?\n2. How do urologists classify patients to frame a\ntherapeutic plan?\n3. What therapeutic means are available, and what are the\nselection criteria?\nTo answer these questions, we surveyed urologists practicing in\nhospitals in various African countries. The aim of this survey is to\ngive a general overview of the current practice, to compare and\ncontrast the various practice protocols and to propose strategies and\nrecommendations for better screening, diagnosis and management\nof prostate cancer.\n2 Methodology\nThe Modern Urology for Africa (MUFA) association is a\nrecently established continental initiative aimed at advancing\nurological care in Africa. MUFA conducted this qualitative\nmulticentric survey as one of its diversi\ufb01ed scopes of research\nactivities. A web-based, self-administered questionnaire targeting\nAfrica\u2019s prostate biopsy and cancer management practices was\ndesigned and electronically disseminated to urologists in 45\nAfrican urology centres. These were mainly African public health\ncare institutions with a functioning urology unit or a surgery unit\nwith an attending urologist.\nThe questionnaire contained the following questions speci\ufb01c to\nprostate cancer:\n\u2022\nProstate biopsy practice: patient consent, prostate biopsy\npreparation, monthly biopsies performed on average,\nbiopsy technique and post-biopsy management.\n\u2022\nProstate cancer diagnosis, staging and imaging modalities.\n\u2022\nProstate cancer management: MDT meetings, management\nprotocol, therapeutic modalities.\n\u2022\nProstate cancer treatment: androgen deprivation therapy\n(medical or surgical), chemotherapy, radiotherapy,\nand immunotherapy.\nAfter pretesting and validation of the form by the authors, a\nGoogle Form was prepared and sent out through email and\nWhatsApp to African urologists for automatic data collection.\nThe study was launched on February 12, 2024 and lasted for 6\nconsecutive weeks. Following data collection, a double check was\ncarried out by authors to eliminate duplicates, and an arithmetical\nanalysis was done. Results were expressed as absolute, mean or\npercentage values. No correlations were performed.\n3 Results\nWe received feedback from 58 centres spanning diverse African\nregions, such as Central Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa, East\nAfrica, and Madagascar, like indicated in Figure 1.\nThese institutions comprised general community hospitals,\nacademic af\ufb01liated hospitals, and university hospitals. Table 1\ndisplays the breakdown of participating hospitals categorised by\ntheir respective African regions.\n3.1 Diagnosis\nIn all subregions of Africa, i.e., Western, Eastern, Central, and\nSouthern, prostate cancer ranks \ufb01rst in terms of prevalence among\nthe studied urological cancers. Regarding the available screening\nand diagnostic modalities, the assay for prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen\n(PSA) is available in almost all the mentioned hospital centres. The\nmajority of centres (n=30, 50%) perform ultrasound-guided\nbiopsies while 20 centres (35%) rely on \ufb01nger-guided prostate\nbiopsies. Only a smaller number of centres perform MRI-guided\nbiopsies (5 centres). Surprisingly, one centre reported an inability to\nperform prostate biopsies due to a lack of expertise (Figure 2).\nThe cross-sectional diagnostic imaging modalities available in\nthe various countries were CT scans (56 centres), followed by MRIs\nFIGURE 1\nRegions and 28 countries represented in the survey (marked\nin blue).\nBiyouma et al.\n10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951\nFrontiers in Urology\nfrontiersin.org\n03\nTABLE 1 Hospitals by African Region participated to the survey.\nGeographic area\nCentre\nCountries\nWest Africa\nCentre Hospitalier National Porto Novo\nBe\u0301nin\nCentre National Hospitalier Universitaire Hubert Koutoukou Maga (CNHU - HKM)\nCentre Hospitalier Universitaire Yalgado Ouedraogo\nBurkina Faso\nCentre Hospitalier Re\u0301gional Tenkodogo\nHo\u0302pital de l'Amitie\u0301\nCentre Hospitalier Universitaire Bogodogo\nCentre Hospitalier Universitaire de Cocody\nCo\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire\nCape Coast Teaching Hospital\nGhana\nHospital Nacional Simao Mendes\nGuinea-Bissau\nJohn F.

For extensive workup, it was possible to do\nscintigraphy in 29 centres, while only 14 centres could do PET\nscans. The distribution of imaging modalities is in Figure 3.\n3.2 Treatment\nIn general, at least 1 therapeutic modality for prostate cancer\ncould be proposed to patients in the centres involved in our survey.\nThe distribution of these modalities varies from one centre to\nanother. The distribution of those various modes of treatment\nbeing practiced in the surveyed urology centres is shown in Table 2.\nRadical prostatectomy was performed in 53.4% of the centres\namong the surveyed centres. Out of those 37 centres performing RP,\n29 centres do <5 RP per month, while 2 centres do between 5 and 10\nRP monthly.\nConcerning nonsurgical therapeutic modalities, they were\ndistributed as shown in Table 3.\nIn regards to radiotherapy, 50 responders (86.2%) reported it\nwas available within their country. We could identify a radiotherapy\nunit/centre in 18 centres within 18 countries. Mainly, external beam\ntherapy was possible; only 4 centres could offer brachytherapy.\nEither surgical or chemical hormonal suppression was possible\nin all centres, except 3 centres where medical castration was not\navailable. So, only 94.8% of the centres could propose chemical\nandrogen deprivation to patients.\nImmunotherapy was offered by 14 centres in 13 countries.\nCryotherapy was only in 2 countries with 1 centre each.\n4 Discussion\nThe diagnosis and management of prostate cancer in Africa is of\ngrowing concern to the urology community. Although prostate\ncancer is one of the most common cancers in men, diagnostic and\ntherapeutic practices vary considerably across the continent,\nin\ufb02uenced by economic, cultural and infrastructural factors. This\nsurvey of urologists in various African hospitals provides an\noverview of current approaches to screening, diagnosis and\ntreatment. By comparing these practices with international\nstandards, this discussion aims to identify speci\ufb01c challenges\nencountered in Africa, regional variations in management\napproaches, and opportunities for improving patient outcomes.\n4.1 Diagnosis of prostate cancer\nIn western practice, digital rectal exam (DRE) is often\nperformed during screening of prostate cancer and is used as a\nsupporting but not de\ufb01nitive tool to detect prostate cancer. Its\ncapabilities are limited due to its questionable reliability, reduced\nsensitivity, and inability to explore the entire surface of the prostate,\nespecially when dealing with small tumours that have not yet\ndeveloped to the point of reaching the prostatic capsule (19). The\nprostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) blood test is also another clinical\nevidence that is used to assess suspicion of prostate cancer (20). In\nhigh-income countries, the use of technologies such as MRI is\nbeginning to have a place in prostate cancer screening and\nsurveillance (21). In Africa, DRE and PSA are almost always used\nfor screening and diagnosing PCA. Determining PSA levels\ndepends on the availability of a biomedical analysis laboratory.\nThe results of this survey clearly demonstrated the unavailability of\nMRI in several centres that responded to the survey.\nIn 2021, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)\ndeveloped several harmonised consensus guidelines for sub-\nSaharan Africa in collaboration with the Africa Cancer Coalition\n(ACC). One of these guidelines is about early detection of prostate\ncancer. In this guideline, the NCCN acknowledges that the\nrecommendations on prostate cancer screening methods and\nintervals are based on expert opinion, and a unanimous\nconsensus has not been reached. Guidelines on when to start and\nstop screening, screening intervals and when to perform a biopsy\nare included in the guideline and should be used after the patient\nhas been properly counselled (22). Just recently, the Lancet\ncommission on prostate cancer published an article that draws\nattention to the increasing number of cases.

Therefore, they recommended an urgent need to\nset up earlier diagnosis systems in low- and middle-income\ncountries. For men of African descent, the case for prostate\ncancer screening lies between the ages of 45 and 70 (21).\n4.2 Overview of the current guidelines for\nthe diagnosis and screening of\nprostate cancer\nScreening for PCa is an area of frequent debate. Screening\npractices and guidelines aim to balance the early detection of\nclinically signi\ufb01cant cancers against the risk of potential\noverdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment of clinically\ninsigni\ufb01cant PCa.\nThe diagnosis of prostate cancer, like any other cancer type, is\nhighly dependent on histopathological con\ufb01rmation. The decision\nto perform a prostate biopsy is made by a urologist based on\nabnormalities identi\ufb01ed during routine screening protocols or after\nclinical examination of a symptomatic patient (23, 24).\nAbnormal \ufb01ndings on DRE, elevation of PSA and a suspicious\nnodule on mp-MRI are the three most common scenarios that\nprompt a urologist to perform a prostate biopsy. There is no debate\namong urologists and oncologists on the need to analyse prostatic\ntissue samples before diagnosing prostate cancer and planning on\nthe treatment options. However, the question is how these tissue\nsamples are obtained (25). There is certain global variation in\npractice in this regard, and our study attempted to highlight the\npractice pattern in Africa.\nUntil recently, a twelve-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-\nguided core needle biopsy has been the standard according to the\nAmerican Urological Association (AUA) and European Association\nof Urology (EAU) guidelines (26). Recently, a TRUS-guided\ntransperineal biopsy has been recommended by these guidelines\nmainly to reduce the risk of infection, which is higher in a\ntransrectal biopsy.\nEf\ufb01cient diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer require\nexhaustive testing techniques speci\ufb01cally designed for the African\nenvironment. A prostate biopsy is a crucial diagnostic procedure\nthat is frequently carried out blindly in many African nations. Our\nresults illustrate that biopsy practices vary between regions.\nAccording to them, 20 centres were still practicing digital-guided\nbiopsies, and 1 centre in particular could not perform biopsies. On\nthe other hand, switching to image-guided biopsies\u2014ideally using\nfusion methods that combine MRI and ultrasound\u2014can greatly\nimprove accuracy. We found out that only 5 centres could perform\nMRI-guided biopsies, but noted a shift toward ultrasound-guided\nbiopsies, which were available in 30 centres. This makes single-use\nbiopsy trocars, biopsy guidance devices, and endorectal\nultrasonography probes necessary.\nBecause image-guided prostate biopsy is a very simple\noperation to learn, urologists may \ufb01nd it easier to embrace if they\nparticipate in short-term training programs in these procedures.\nA study reported that twelve procedures are necessary to perform\nhigh-quality TRUS-guided prostate biopsies without compromising\nprostate cancer detection; therefore, they strongly recommended\ntraining under direct supervision for a minimum of 12 cases before\nallowing TRUS-guided biopsy without supervision (27).\nIn the era of imaging-guided biopsy of the prostate, \ufb01nger-\nguided prostate biopsy still has a role in low- to middle-income\ncountries. Concerning \ufb01nger-guided biopsy and TRUS-biopsy\npractices in Africa, even if the \ufb01rst one is far from gold-standard,\nit remains a suitable alternative in resource-limited settings,\nespecially when the prostate is clinically abnormal (28). Perhaps\nin patients with palpable disease, the addition of \ufb01nger-guided\nprostate biopsy of these areas increased the positive predictive\nvalue over transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsies alone (29).\nAlso, many countries are still practicing \u2018out-of-pocket\u2019\nhealthcare, and something as simple as a TRUS-guided prostate\nbiopsy may be totally unaffordable. Therefore, in low- to middle-\nincome countries, the cost of a prostate biopsy needs to be\nconsidered, as well as the cost to the patient, which may include\ntime off work and travel costs.\nWe did not distinguish between transrectal and transperineal\nultrasound or MRI-guided biopsy technique in our survey;\ntherefore, we could not discuss or compare the advantages of one\nover the other, including a reduction in infectious complications,\nimproved quality of prostate sampling, and rebiopsy rates, which\nwere reported in a systematic review on biopsy approaches as 15.4%\nin transrectal vs. 5.26% in transperineal (30).\nTABLE 3 Availability of non-surgical therapeutic modalities and their distribution among represented hospitals and countries.\nTreatment Modality\nCentres (n=56)\nCountries (n=28)\nNumber (n)\nPercentage (%)\nNumber (n)\nPercentage (%)\nChemotherapy\n46\n82%\n27\n96\nRadiotherapy\n18\n32%\n18\n85.7\nBrachytherapy\n4\n7%\n4\n14.2\nHormonotherapy\n47\n84%\n26\n93.1\nCryotherapy\n2\n3.5%\n2\n7\nImmunotherapy\n14\n25%\n13\n46\nBiyouma et al.\n10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951\nFrontiers in Urology\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nEven though we did not evaluate prostate biopsy antibiotic\nprophylaxis protocols applied by each centre in our survey,\nfollowing a literature review on the topic, we found a study\ndedicated to analysing post-biopsy complications in relation to\nantibiotic prophylactic protocols conducted by Tulone et al. They\nobserved that prophylaxis based on the use of \ufb02uoroquinolones\nappears to be associated with a lower risk of infectious\ncomplications following transrectal prostate biopsy, compared to\nother prophylactic regimens, such as those involving\ncephalosporins or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (31). In addition,\nanother study on the topic conducted in Nigeria comparing two\ngroups of patients among whom Group 1 patients received a single\ndose of 1 g of amikacin intravenously 30 minutes prior to the\nprocedure, followed by the immediate administration of 500 mg of\noral cipro\ufb02oxacin after the transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate\nbiopsy (TRUS-PB), while Group 2 patients were given the same\nantibiotics, but with a notable difference: cipro\ufb02oxacin was initiated\none day before the procedure. Both patient groups were subsequently\nadministered cipro\ufb02oxacin twice daily for a total duration of \ufb01ve days\n(32). They found a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the incidence and severity\nof sepsis in the second group. In this study, it was requested that\nantibiotics be used. We wanted to see clinical habits and compare\nthem with the recommendations of learned societies.\nRecommendations on prostate cancer screening and early\ndetection from main international urology societies, including\nAUA, EAU and NCCN guidelines, are highlighted and\nsummarised in Table 4 (22, 33).\nThe commonly used prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) screening\nis not widely accessible or affordable in this region. To address this,\nalternative screening methods like risk assessment approaches and\ncost-effective PSA tests are being explored to target high-risk\nindividuals and improve screening access (18).\n4.3 How these guidelines are implemented\nin practice in various regions of Africa\nClinical practice guidelines (CPGs) serve as frameworks to unify\ndiagnostic criteria and guide clinical decision-making and to\npromote the highest standards of urological clinical care through\neducation, research and the formation of health care policy. In\nAfrica, the limited resources may preclude urologists from strictly\nadhering to international guidelines and recommendations. In\naddition, screening practices and guidelines for PCa and their\navailability vary across Africa (24). So, some countries have\ndeveloped their own national guidelines. The American\nUrological Association (AUA), the European Urological\nAssociation (EAU), and the National Comprehensive Cancer\nNetwork (NCCN) have standardised guidelines for the\nmanagement of prostate cancer. From those guidelines, African\nmanagement of prostate cancer is extrapolated. As an example in\nSouth Africa, local practitioners were commissioned to revise\ninternational CPGs with a view to applicability to South African\nclinical practice (34). Prostate cancer screening consists of\nsystematic screening for the disease in an asymptomatic\npopulation. This early screening aims at early detection of these\ndiseases and risk strati\ufb01cation; unfortunately, the major challenge\nexperienced in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs)\nis the late presentation of PC patients in health facilities due partly\nto lack of screening, highlighting the need for accessible and\naffordable early detection programs (35). Despite the fact that\nmass screening is not recommended compared to individualised\ninformed screening due to the risk of overdiagnosis and\novertreatment, many African countries, especially in SSA, still\npractice population-based screening, often initiated by local\nhospitals through public health campaigns. For example, in a\nTABLE 4 A summary of society's recommendations on prostate cancer early detection protocol.\nGuideline\nWho should be\nscreened? *\nFrequency\nof screening\nMethod\nof screening\nWhen to\ndo biopsy\nmp-MRI\nAUA 2023\n\u00b7 Age 50-69 yrs.\n\u00b7 Age 45-69 yrs. for high-\nrisk men**\n\u00b7Every 2 \u2013 4 yrs.\n\u00b7 Serum PSA is the \ufb01rst\nline.\n\u00b7 DRE can be an\nadjunct modality\n\u00b7 Elevated PSA\u2020\n\u00b7 Abnormal mp-MRI\n\u00b7 Before a repeat biopsy.\n\u00b7 Before initial biopsy\nif available\nEAU 2024\n\u00b7 Age > 50b\n\u00b7 Age > 45 (high risk\nmen) **\n\u00b7 Age > 40 for\nBRCA2 mutation\n\u00b7Every 2 yrs.\n\u00b7 Serum PSA\n\u00b7 DRE is equally useful\n\u00b7 Elevated PSA > 3ng/ml\n\u00b7 Abnormal DRE\n\u00b7 Before a repeat biopsy.\n\u00b7 Before initial biopsy\nif available\nNCCN 2024\n\u00b7 Age 45-75 yrs.\n\u00b7 Age 40-75 yrs.

The threshold is as low as 2.6 ng/ml for younger men.\nbThe EAU recommends to avoid/stop prostate cancer screening in men with < 15 yrs. Life expectancy.\nBiyouma et al.\n10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951\nFrontiers in Urology\nfrontiersin.org\n08\ncommunity-based screening program in Nigeria, 10% of men 50\nyears of age and over had a PSA over 4 mg/ml, and most had a PSA\ngreater than 10 mg/ml. 8.5% were biopsied, and 1% had\nhistologically con\ufb01rmed prostate cancer; no information was\nprovided about treatments and outcomes (36). South African\nguidelines recommend that PCa screening (PSA and digital rectal\nexamination [DRE]) should be performed in all men from 45 years\nonwards in the absence of identi\ufb01able risk factors and from 40 years\nin black men, where there is a family history of PCa and other\nidenti\ufb01able risk factors (37).\nWhile international guidelines are shifting toward transperineal\nprostate biopsy and MRI-fusion biopsy, in our context, TRUS-guided\nbiopsy as well as \ufb01nger-guided biopsy are still commonly done (14).\nTreatment with curative intent is not widely available and is\noften very costly in SSA. Currently, there is no consensus on the\nmanagement of prostate cancer in Africa, as most of the treatment\noptions are directly adopted from international guidelines. The\navailability of treatment modalities, namely, androgen-deprivation\ntherapy, chemotherapy, radical prostatectomy, external beam\nradiotherapy and brachytherapy, varied widely among the\ncountries. Notwithstanding, several authors have proposed\nprostate cancer updates depending on the stage and African\nsubregion (18, 24, 38\u201340).\n4.4 Challenges or barriers that exist in\nimplementing these guidelines in\ndifferent regions\nDiagnosis of prostate cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa is challenging\ndue to limited access to diagnostic tools and healthcare resources, in\naddition to a low level of awareness by the community and the myths\nand misconceptions associated with it. The misconceptions include\ndenial of conjugal rights if diagnosed with PCa, and one of the\nprevention methods is having multiple sexual partners, which\npredisposes for sexually transmitted disease and often judgement\nfrom the community (41). Clinical evaluation and digital rectal\nexamination are commonly used, but PSA testing, magnetic\nresonance imaging, and biopsy are often restricted to a few locations.\nConsequently, many men in this region are diagnosed with advanced-\nstage cancer (39). The data from our study demonstrate an unequal\nand insuf\ufb01cient distribution of medical devices in healthcare facilities\nacross Africa necessary for the diagnosis and management of prostate\ncancer. For example, 22 countries have centres capable of performing a\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scan, 21 countries have centres with\nMRI facilities, 10 respondents\u2019 countries have centres equipped with\nscintigraphy, and only 5 countries have centres capable of performing a\npositron emission tomography (PET) scan. This aligns with data\nobtained from the Global Health Observatory in 2014 (42), which\nshowed the limited availability of cancer care equipment in Africa like\nmammography units, radiotherapy units, CT scanners, gamma camera\nunits, MRI machines, and PET scanners. Radiotherapy centres are also\nscarce, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The availability of multimodal\nPCa treatment in various African countries is key to effectively\nmanaging this disease and adhering to standard recommendations.\nCountries such as Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and the Central\nAfrican Republic, according to this study \ufb01nding, do not have\nradiotherapy centres, forcing eligible patients to seek treatment in\nneighbouring countries with associated economic costs. In Eswatini,\nthe costs associated with prostate cancer (PCa) management are\noverwhelming. Due to the absence of radiation therapy in the\ncountry, the government must refer PCa patients to private hospitals\nin South Africa. While surgical procedures like transurethral resection\ncan be performed locally, most patients also seek chemotherapy\ntreatment in South Africa. The total annual cost of PCa to Eswatini\nis estimated at $6 million, including direct expenses for treatments and\nnon-medical costs like transportation and lodging, which impose a\nsigni\ufb01cant \ufb01nancial burden on patients (43).\nUrologists in Africa may encounter dif\ufb01culties adhering to\ninternational recommendations due to these resource and\nknowledge limitations. In our study, it was observed that not all\nurological centres perform radical prostatectomy due to a lack of\ntechnical expertise and adequate equipment. Furthermore, among\nthose centres that do perform this procedure, the average monthly\nnumber of prostatectomies conducted by centres indicating\naf\ufb01rmative responses was approximately 5.33 cases per year. Our\n\ufb01ndings also highlight there are centres that do not offer radical\nprostatectomy services, which signi\ufb01cantly impacts both the quality\nof patient care and training of urologists.\nThe dif\ufb01culty for African urological centres to accurately\ndiagnose different stages of prostate cancer, due to limitations in\nexisting diagnostic tests, can result in either underdiagnosis or\novertreatment, posing a barrier to the implementation of the best\ninternational recommendations. Furthermore, the lack of attention\ngiven to the severity of prostate cancer in men compared to other\ntypes of cancer in women, such as breast and cervical cancer, can\nlead to a lack of attention and resources for the screening and early\nmanagement of prostate cancer. The fact that many cases of\nprostate cancer in Africa remain undiagnosed and untreated\nre\ufb02ects systemic barriers to accessing healthcare and standard\ntreatment. In particular, the centralisation of oncology facilities\n(including investigations, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) in\nurban areas and the shortage of specialised urologists and\noncologists make access to care even more dif\ufb01cult for patients in\nrural areas. Public health expenditures are only $8 per capita,\nsigni\ufb01cantly below the recommended $34. Most healthcare costs\nare paid out-of-pocket, comprising around 70% of total health\nspending (44). The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)\nmainly covers civil servants, leaving a large portion of the\npopulation uninsured. Endemic poverty exacerbates the situation,\nmaking healthcare unaffordable for many patients and leading to\ndelays in seeking medical care (45). These systemic and\norganisational challenges can affect the quality of urological\npractices in Africa and explain why they may not always meet\ninternational standards. Aligning with international standards for\nprostate cancer management requires an upgrade of the technical\ninfrastructure in African hospitals for prostate cancer diagnosis,\nimproving the accessibility of these technical platforms to all\npatients, as well as strengthening training programs for healthcare\nprofessionals, including urologists, oncologists, and radiotherapists,\nto ensure they have the skills and expertise needed to provide\nquality care to prostate cancer patients.\nBiyouma et al.\n10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951\nFrontiers in Urology\nfrontiersin.org\n09\n4.5 Limited access to diagnostic and\ntreatment resources and up-to-date\ntraining for SSA Urologists\nWith the recent advancement in the standardised reporting of\nprostatic MRI and the wide availability of it in higher-income\ncountries, it has been used for the detection, localisation, and\ncharacterisation of clinically signi\ufb01cant prostate cancers (46). This\nrecent development of using MRI as a screening tool in the\ndetection of prostate cancer has aided urologists and oncologists\nin performing targeted biopsies and also avoiding unnecessary\nbiopsies. The impact of these targeted biopsies is very high,\nespecially in patients with prior negative biopsy results and still\nsuspicious DRE and PSA results. In this survey, 46.7% (n=21)\ncentres only have access to MRI, which will affect the quality of\nservice provided, resulting in underdiagnosis by missing the cancer\non biopsy or increased performance of biopsies.\nRadical prostatectomy has undergone a very rapid change from\nan open approach to a laparoscopic and robotic approach. From\ninitial reports of both laparoscopic and robotic approaches in the\nbeginning of 2000, it has gained wide popularity (47, 48). Now,\nminimally invasive radical prostatectomy, speci\ufb01cally robotic, is the\nstandard. 91.5% of radical prostatectomies and more than 84% of\nprostatectomies in England and the USA, respectively, were done\nrobotically (49). In Sub-Saharan Africa, few centres are able to\nperform radical prostatectomies, and usually it is an open approach.\nThe eligibility of patients for this curative approach is also\ndependent on early presentation, proper staging, and the\navailability of skilled urologists who can offer the surgery.\nSouth Africa is the \ufb01rst African country to perform robotic radical\nprostatectomy and also has many robotic surgery centres (50). The\nprice of acquiring robots and the running cost per procedure have\nmade it unthinkable for most African centres. In addition to its\nexpensiveness, the unavailability of training centres in Africa and the\ndif\ufb01culty of securing on-hand training in high-income countries make\neven the disparity in radical prostatectomy an ongoing challenge. The\nVattikuti Foundation has played a signi\ufb01cant role in training more than\n50 fellows in robotic surgery in India (51). Africa also needs\ncollaboration from this type of foundation and international\nstakeholders to train and equip the urologists with the necessary skills.\n4.6 The need for strengthening the\ntechnical skills\nIt is important for urologists to remain up-to-date regarding\nresearch and clinical guidelines within their specialty. Prostate cancer\nrarely involves a single treatment; patient care can be as diverse as the\ndisease itself. Its management often requires a multispecialty team\ndedicated to managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment. This\napproach has been reported to improve quality-of-life issues for these\npatients. The availability of primary treatment modalities, namely,\nradical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy and\nbrachytherapy, varied widely among the countries in which the\nurologists practiced based on their referral patterns.\nUro-oncology has emerged as a subspecialty that plays an\nimportant role in the daily practice and care of urologic\nmalignancies. Its role is so important in standardising the care and\nin a continuation of urologic oncology training, especially with updated\nguidelines, changing treatment modalities, new oncological drugs,\ndevelopments in advanced technology, and the increasing use of\nlaparoscopic, robotic, and endoscopic techniques. A study showed\nthat 40.54% of the urologists did not \ufb01nd the uro-oncology training in\ntheir own country to be suf\ufb01cient, so there is a need for training after\nresidency to be supported by not only the authorities but also the\nurologists in the \ufb01eld to strengthen their skills (52). Also, surgery\ntraining is essential; this is illustrated by the results of multi-\ninstitutional analysis, which showed that only 11% of patients treated\nby high-volume surgeons experienced a biochemical recurrence at \ufb01ve\nyears, compared to 18% of patients treated by low-volume surgeons\n(53). Performing radical prostatectomy is a key tool for urologists\ndealing with prostate cancer, especially for eligible patients. Mastering\nthis technique comes with training and practice. Postoperative\nmorbidity in high-volume centres has a 6% absolute reduction in\npostoperative complication rates (26% vs. 32%), an 8% absolute\nreduction in late urinary complications (20% vs. 28%), and a 4%\nabsolute reduction in long-term incontinence (16% vs. 20%), compared\nto those treated by low-volume surgeons (54). Apart from fellowship,\nurologists indicated an interest in taking courses designed to educate\nthem on prostate cancer care even after residency. Consequently, they\nshould be encouraged to participate in continuous medical education\nand workshops, to be members of different societies and groups, to\nsubscribe to journals or newsletters, to attend scienti\ufb01c meetings and\nprograms, and to collaborate with other \ufb01elds. Guidelines are\ndeveloped to improve the quality of patient care.\n4.7 Implications for clinical practice\nThis study has shown a signi\ufb01cant disparity in diagnostic and\ntreatment resources between different centres, not only based on the\ncountry but also within the same country. This situation has a\nconsiderable practical impact, particularly on the reliability of\ndiagnosis, the quality of disease staging, and especially patient\nmanagement. Even though many efforts have been made to\nimprove diagnostic means, as highlighted by our study (all centres\nperform prostate biopsies except one), many patients are diagnosed at\na late metastatic stage, mainly due to the absence of early screening or\nthe unavailability of tests. Digital rectal examination and PSA testing\nare available in almost all centres. In a review, Jalloh et al. reported\nthat the unavailability of certain equipment, the lack of expertise\namong human resources, and the high cost of exams and treatments\nresult in each centre operating according to the available means (18).\nSimilarly, it was reported by Tanzanian authors that there is a\nsigni\ufb01cant disparity in the prices of diagnostics and treatments\nbetween different centres in the country, and these prices remain\nrelatively high compared to the patients\u2019 means (55). It would be\nbene\ufb01cial to establish or encourage collaboration between different\ncentres within the same country and the sub-region, which would\nincrease the level of detection and patient management.\nBiyouma et al.\n10.3389/fruro.2025.1496951\nFrontiers in Urology\nfrontiersin.org\n10\n4.8 Study limitation\nThere was no systematic sampling for selecting the hospitals\ninvolved in this study, and therefore the possibility of sampling\nerrors exists, and the results may not re\ufb02ect the overall picture of\nprostate cancer diagnostic and treatment modalities in Africa. Our\nsample size and unknown response rate may not represent the\npopulation for which the survey was intended.\nThese may mean our results may be subject to the in\ufb02uence of\nchance factors. Although there was a mixture of different African\ncountry representatives, information about the unrepresented\ncountries may have changed our result signi\ufb01cantly. It is also\nimportant to recognise that the responding urologist may have\nlimited knowledge about the countries he is practicing in. The\nquestions were not competency-based and did not assess\nde\ufb01ciencies of skills or knowledge in PCa. Therefore, it was not\npossible to determine whether any de\ufb01ciencies in skills or\nknowledge were signi\ufb01cant enough to affect their response.\nFurthermore, the possibility of response bias cannot be\ncompletely eliminated in this study.\n5 Conclusion\nThe diagnosis and management of prostate cancer in Africa face\nsigni\ufb01cant challenges due to late diagnosis, inadequate manpower,\npoor health facilities, and limited treatment options. Our survey\nhighlights disparities in diagnostic capabilities, with some centres\nlacking essential imaging modalities and biopsy techniques.\nTreatment options also vary widely, with only a few centres\noffering comprehensive care, including surgery and advanced\ntherapies. There\u2019s a need to improve early detection and patient\noutcomes by increasing public awareness, developing screening\nprograms, and investing in novel diagnostic and treatment\noptions. Strengthening technical skills through continuous\neducation and training, enhancing infrastructure, and fostering\ncollaboration among healthcare centres are essential steps toward\nreducing the burden of prostate cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\nin the article/supplementary material.
